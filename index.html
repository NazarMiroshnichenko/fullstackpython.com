                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>You're knee deep in learning the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
programming language. The syntax is beginning to make sense. The first
few &quot;AHA!&quot; moments are hitting you. Now you are excited for continued
direction to accelerate your learning.</p>
<p>This guide explains each piece of a Python web stack. If you want to deploy
a web application built with Django, Flask, Pyramid, or another
Python-based web framework, you've come to the right place.</p>
<p>There are a few other fantastic Python guides that you may want to read if
you're not yet ready to deploy your application.</p>
<p>For general Python learning, read Kenneth Reitz's
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/">The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python</a>.</p>
<p>To deploy a Python web application to the Heroku platform-as-a-service
(described below in this guide), check out
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.deploydjango.com/">Deploying Django</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not coming in with any software development background,
you may find my post on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mattmakai.com/learning-python-for-non-developers.html">Learning Python</a>
useful.</p>
<p>This guide has a different focus from the above resources. Here I
focus on explaining several ways of for how the Python <em>web application</em>
stack works from server infrastructure through JavaScript execution on a
user's browser.</p>
<p>People learning Python generally have at least one of the three following
goals:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Build web applications</li>
<li>Process, analyze, and visualize data</li>
<li>Script server administration</li>
</ol>
<p>This guide will be most useful to people building web applications and
scripting server administration.</p>

                    <h1>Servers</h1>
                    <p>There are four options for setting up infrastructure to serve a
web application:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>&quot;Bare metal&quot; servers</li>
<li>Virtualized servers</li>
<li>Infrastructure-as-a-service</li>
<li>Platform-as-a-service</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="bare-metal">
<h2>Bare metal</h2>
<p>The term <em>bare metal</em> refers to purchasing the actual hardware and hooking
it up to the Internet either through a business-class internet service
provider (ISP) or
<a class="reference external" href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/colocation/a/what_colocation.htm">co-locating the server</a> with other servers. A &quot;business-class&quot; ISP is necessary because
most residential Internet service agreements prohibt and will eventually
block traffic to web servers. You may be able to get away with low traffic
volume but if your site serves a lot of traffic it will catch an ISPs
filters.</p>
<p>The bare metal option offers the most control over the server configuration,
usually has the highest performance for the price, but also is the most
expensive upfront option and the highest ongoing maintenance. With bare
metal servers the ongoing operating cost is the electricity the server(s)
use as well as handling repairs when server components malfunction. You're
taking on manual labor working with hardware as well as the rest of the
software stack.</p>
<p>Buy actual hardware from a vendor either pre-built or as a collection of
components that you assemble yourself. Here is an
<a class="reference external" href="http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/building-a-quad-core-server">example of a server buildout</a>. The post is a couple of years old but those are the
rough components you need to put together your own server. You can also buy
pre-configured servers from Dell or HP. Those servers tend to be in
smaller case form factors (called &quot;blades&quot;) but are correspondingly more
expensive than putting off-the-shelf components together yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virtualized-servers">
<h2>Virtualized servers</h2>
<p>Virtual private servers (VPSs) are slices of hardware on top of a larger
bare metal server. Virtualization software such as
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.xen.org/">Xen</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.vmware.com/virtualization/what-is-virtualization.html">VMWare</a>
allow providers such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">prgmr</a> (as well as a many others) to provide
fractions of a full server that appear as their own instances. For example,
a server with an 8-core Xeon processor and 16 gigabytes of memory can be
sliced into 8 pieces with the equivalent of 1-core and 2 gigabytes of
memory.</p>
<p>The primary disadvantage of virtualized servers is that there is resource
overhead in the virtualization process. In addition, physical constraints
such as heavy I/O operations by a single virtualized instance on persistent
storage can cause performance bottlenecks for other virtualized instances on
the shared server. Choosing virtualized server hosting should be based on
your needs for urgency of service ticket requests and the frequency you
require for ongoing maintenance such as persistent storage backups.</p>

<h2>Virtualized servers resources</h2>

</div>
<div class="section" id="infrastructure-as-a-service">
<h2>Infrastructure-as-a-service</h2>
<p>Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) overlaps with virtualized servers
because the resources are often presented in the same way. The
difference between virtualized servers and IaaS is the granularity of the
billing cycle. IaaS generally encourages a finer granularity based on minutes
or hours of server usage instead of on monthly billing cycles.</p>
<p>IaaS can be used in combination with virtualized servers to provide
dynamic upscaling for heavy traffic. When traffic is low then virtualized
servers can solely be used. This combination of resources reduces cost at
the expense of greater complexity in the dynamically scaled infrastructure.</p>
<p>The most common IaaS platforms are
<a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to IaaS platforms is the lock-in if you have to write
custom code to deploy, dynamically scale, and generally understand your
infrastructure. Every platform has its quirks. For example,
Amazon's standard <a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">Elastic Block Store</a> storage
infrastructure has at least an order of magnitude worse I/O throughput
than working with your local disk. Your application's database queries may
work great locally but then when you deploy the performance is inadequate.
Amazon has <a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/07/31/announcing-provisioned-iops-for-amazon-ebs/">higher throughput EBS instances</a>
but you will pay correspondingly more for them. EBS throughput is just
one of many quirks you need to understand before committing to an
IaaS platform.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="platform-as-a-service">
<h2>Platform-as-a-service</h2>
<p>A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provides infrastructure and a software layer
on which a web application is deployed. The PaaS layer defines how the
application accesses resources such as computing time, files, and
external services. The PaaS provides a higher-level abstraction for working
with computing resources than deploying an application to a server or IaaS.</p>
<p>A PaaS makes deployment and operations easier because it forces the developer
to conform applications to the PaaS architecture.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://gondor.io/">Gondor</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="https://openshift.redhat.com/community/get-started/python">OpenShift</a> are
platform-as-services that support Python web applications. Each one requires
varying tradeoffs to deploy to their respective platforms.</p>
<img alt="Traditional LAMP server stack versus a Platform-as-a-Service stack" class="technical-diagram" src="../img/servers-versus-paas.png" />
<p>If you go the PaaS route, you can skip over the operating system and web
server sections because they are baked into PaaS offerings. PaaS offerings
generally start at the WSGI server layer.</p>

                    <h1>Operating System</h1>
                    <p>The operating system runs on top of the server or virtual server
and controls access to computing resources. The only operating
system I can recommend for production Python web stack deployments is
a flavor of Linux. Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases, Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, and CentOS are all viable options.</p>
<p><em>Side note</em>: Mac OS X is fine for development activities. Windows and Mac
OS X are not appropriate for most test and production deployments unless
there is a specific reason why you must use them in lieu of Linux.</p>
<div class="section" id="ubuntu">
<h2>Ubuntu</h2>
<p>Ubuntu is a Linux distribution packaged by the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical Ltd</a> company. Ubuntu uses the
Debian distribution as a base for packages, including the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.debian.org/Apt">aptitude package
manager</a>. For desktop versions of Ubuntu,
GNOME (until the 11.04 release) or Unity (11.10 through current)
is added to the distribution to provide a user interface.</p>
<p>Ubuntu <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS">Long Term Support (LTS)</a> releases
are the recommended versions to use for deployments. LTS versions receive
five years of post-release updates from Canonical. Every two years, Canonical
creates a new LTS release, which allows for an easy upgrade path as well
as flexibility in skipping every other LTS release if necessary.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>
(RHEL) and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.centos.org/">Community ENTerprise Operating System</a>
(CentOS) are the same distribution. The only difference between the two
(other than the name) is that CentOS is an open source, liberally
licensed free derivative of RHEL.</p>
<p>RHEL and CentOS use a different package manager and command-line interface
from Debian-based Linux distributions: RPM Package Manager (RPM) and the
Yellowdog Updater, Modified (YUM). RPM has a specific .rpm file format
to handle the packaging and installation of libraries and applications. YUM
provides a command-line interface for interacting with the RPM system.</p>

                    <h1>Web Server</h1>
                    <p>A web server handles Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests from
clients. The client is usually a browser such as Internet Explorer, Firefox,
and Chrome, but it can also be a headless browser like
<a class="reference external" href="http://phantomjs.org/">phantomjs</a> (commonly used for testing), a
commandline utility like wget or curl, or a web crawler. The web server
processes the request and sends a status code and depending on the
status code a content response as well.</p>
<p>In a simple case, the client will request a static asset such as a picture
or JavaScript file. The file sits on the file system in a location the
web server is authorized to access and the web server sends the file
to the client with a 200 status code. If the client already requested the
file and the file has not changed, the web server will pass back a 304
&quot;Not modified&quot; response indicating the client already has the latest version
of that file.</p>
<img alt="Web server and web browser request-response cycles" class="technical-diagram" src="../img/web-browser-server-requests.png" />
<p>A web server sends files to a web browser based on the web browser's
request. In the first request, the browser accessed the
&quot;www.fullstackpython.com&quot;
address and the server responded with the index.html HTML-formatted file.
That HTML file contained references to other files, such as style.css and
script.js that the browser then requested from the server.</p>
<p>Sending static assets (such as CSS and JavaScript files) can eat up a
large amount of bandwidth which is why using a Content Delivery Network
(CDN) is important when possible (see the content delivery network
section for a more detailed explanation).</p>

                    <h1>Database</h1>
                    <p>A database is an abstraction on top of an operating system's file system to
ease creating, reading, updating, and deleting persistent data. The
database storage abstraction most commonly used in Python web development is
sets of relational tables. Alternative storage abstractions are explained in
the NoSQL section.</p>
<p>Relational databases store all data in a series of tables. Interconnections
between the tables are specified as <em>foreign keys</em>.</p>
<p>Databases storage implementations vary in complexity. SQLite, a database
included with Python, creates a single file for all data per database.
Other databases such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL have more complicated
persistence schemes while offering additional advanced features that are
useful for web application data storage.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> are two of the most common open source
databases.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> is a database that is stored in a single
file on disk. SQLite is built into Python but is only built for access
by a single connection at a time.</p>
<div class="section" id="database-connections-with-python">
<h2>Database connections with Python</h2>
<p>To work with a relational database using Python, you need to use a code
library. The most common libraries for relational databases are:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg2</a> for PostgreSQL</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.4">MySQLdb</a> for MySQL</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/">cx_Oracle</a> for Oracle</p>
<p>SQLite support is built into Python 2.7+ and therefore a separate library
is not necessary. Simply &quot;import sqlite3&quot; to begin interfacing with the
single file-based database.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="database-third-party-services">
<h2>Database third-party services</h2>
<p>Numerous companies run scalable database servers as a hosted service.
Depending on the provider, there can be several advantages to using a
hosted database third-party service:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>automated backups and recovery</li>
<li>tightened security configurations</li>
<li>easy vertical scaling</li>
</ol>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a>

                    <h1>Web Framework</h1>
                    <p>A web application framework is a collection of libraries that
provide functionality to accomplish common operations for the web. These
common operations include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>URL routing</li>
<li>HTML, XML, JSON, and other output format templating</li>
<li>Database manipulation</li>
<li>Security against Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and other attacks</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all web frameworks include functionality for all of the above
functionality. Frameworks fall somewhere between simply executing a
single use case and attempting to be everything to every developer with
increased complexity.</p>
<p>For example, the Django web application framework includes an
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer that abstracts relational database
read, write, query, and delete operations. However, Django's ORM
does not work (without modification) on non-relational databases such
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.basho.com/">Riak</a>.
Other web frameworks such as Flask and Pyramid are generally easier to
use with non-relational databases by incorporating external Python libraries.</p>
<div class="section" id="web-framework-monitoring">
<h2>Web Framework Monitoring</h2>
<p>Logging is a common mechanism for monitoring web applications written with a
web framework. Runtime exceptions that prevent code from running are
important to log to investigate and fix the source of the problems.
Informational and debugging logging also helps to understand how the
application is performing even if code is working as intended.</p>
<p>Logging is often grouped into several categories:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Information</li>
<li>Debug</li>
<li>Warning</li>
<li>Error</li>
</ol>
<p>Logging errors that occur while a web framework is running is crucial to
understanding how your application is performing.
<a class="reference external" href="http://raven.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Raven</a> is a Python client for the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry">Sentry</a> exception logging and
aggregation application. Raven provides the way to send exceptions to
Sentry, which should be deployed on a separate server from your production
infrastructure. Raven can also be used by Python scripts to send other
log data to Sentry for aggregation. Sentry provides a clean web application
interface for viewing the exceptions. Sentry can also be configured with a
mail plugin to send emails when exceptions occur.</p>

                    <h1>Static Content</h1>
                    <p>Some content on a website does not change and therefore should be served
up either directly through the web server or a content delivery network (CDN).
Examples include JavaScript, image, and CSS files.</p>
<p>A CDN is a third party that serves your static files.
<a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/files/">Rackspace Cloud Files</a>
are examples of CDNs. The purpose of a CDN is to remove the load of static
file requests from web servers that are handling dynamic web content. For
example, if you have an nginx server that handles both static files and
acts as a front for a Green Unicorn WSGI server on a 512 megabyte
virtual private server, the nginx server will run into resource
constraints under heavy traffic. A CDN can remove the need to serve static
assets from that nginx server so it can purely act as a pass through for
requests to the Green Unicorn WSGI server.</p>
<p>CDNs distribute request load globally by using data centers in different
locations.</p>

                    <p>Caching can reduce load on servers by storing the results of common
operations and serving the precomputed answers to clients.</p>
<p>For example, instead of retrieving data from database tables that rarely
change, you can store the values in-memory. Retrieving values from an
in-memory location is far faster than retrieving them from a database (which
stores them on a persistent disk like a hard drive). When the cached values
change the system can invalidate the cache and re-retrieve the updated values
for future requests.</p>
<p>A cache can be created for multiple layers of the stack.</p>
