[**DevOps, Continuous Delivery... and You**](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/devops-continuous-delivery-you.html)
is a blog post with the slides and notes based on a class I taught at
the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/) this past week. Most 
of the content is relevant as a brief introduction to 
[DevOps](https://www.fullstackpython.com/devops.html) and Continuous Delivery, 
especially for junior developers and less-technical managers of software 
teams. Let me know via an email or tweet if you enjoy the format and I will 
do the same style blog post with future technical talks.

Speaking of feedback on open source projects, 
[this GitHub issue thread named "**thank you**"](https://github.com/jhund/filterrific/issues/147#issuecomment-341867147)
is incredible to read. The issue ticket blew up on the front page of Hacker
News as an example of how powerful genuine positive comments can be for 
project maintainers. Every time I get a thank you tweet 
([like this one](https://twitter.com/foozmeat/status/928834578864750592)), 
email or GitHub issue it certainly helps to motivate me to continue working 
hard on Full Stack Python.

[**Contributing to open source**](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/132/contributing-to-open-source) 
is a recent [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/) podcast episode in 
the same vein as thanking your maintainer. Working on open source projects
with your own contributions to documentation or simple bug fixes can be a
great way to become a better programmer. I particularly enjoyed the 
recommendations of the panel to cut your teeth on smaller open source projects
rather than trying to jump into a massive codebase like 
[Django](https://github.com/django/django) or the 
[CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) implementation. Take a listen
to that podcast episode if you are new to open source or have been wondering
how to get involved.

As always, send me an email or [submit an issue ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/issues) 
to let me know how to improve 
[Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) 
as I continue to 
[fill in the table of contents](https://www.fullstackpython.com/table-of-contents.html) 
with [new pages](https://www.fullstackpython.com/change-log.html)
and 
[new tutorials](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog.html).
