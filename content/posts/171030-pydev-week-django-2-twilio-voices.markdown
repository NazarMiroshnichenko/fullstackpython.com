[**PyDev of the Week**](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/category/pydevoftheweek/) 
is a developer interview series by 
[Mike Driscoll](https://github.com/driscollis) that asks Python developers 
how they started programming, what projects they're currently coding and advice
they have for new developers. Mike was kind enough to 
interview me in the current October 30th post.

In the PyDev interview I gave a big shoutout to the fine folks working on the
[Django project](https://www.fullstackpython.com/django.html), which is 
currently beta testing the major upcoming
[**Django 2.0 release**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/2.0/).
Django 2.0 is the first release to support only Python 3, specifically 
[Python 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/2.0/#python-compatibility).

One bit I missed from the PyDev interview is a new program I'm working on
called [**Twilio Voices**](http://www.twiliovoices.com), which pays developers
to write great technical tutorials for the 
[Twilio blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog). We have already published a slew 
of awesome Python walkthroughs such as:

* [How I Hacked My University's Registration System with Twilio SMS](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/06/hacked-my-universitys-registration-system-python-twilio.html)
* [Getting Started on Geospatial Analysis with Python, GeoJSON and GeoPandas](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/geospatial-analysis-python-geojson-geopandas.html)
* [Wedding at Scale: How I Used Twilio, Python and Google to Automate My Wedding](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/04/wedding-at-scale-how-i-used-twilio-python-and-google-to-automate-my-wedding.html) 
* [Never Forget A Friendâ€™s Birthday with Python, Flask and Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/09/never-forget-friends-birthday-python-flask-twilio.html)

Take a look at the [Twilio Voices page](http://www.twiliovoices.com/) and 
submit the interest form if you want to get paid to write code tutorials 
and we'll take care of promoting your work to other developers. 

As always, send me an email or [submit an issue ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/issues) 
to let me know how to improve 
[Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) 
as I continue to 
[fill in the table of contents](https://www.fullstackpython.com/table-of-contents.html) 
with [new pages](https://www.fullstackpython.com/change-log.html)
and 
[new tutorials](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog.html).
