[Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) started five years ago
on December 23, 2012. I originally built it to help out a bunch of junior
developers that kept asking me the same questions over and over via email.
It seemed like the answers would be useful to many more people if I put them
on a publicly-accessible site.

Little did I know that five years later I'd have written over 120,000 words
on the site, which has now been read by over 2.5 million developers.
