How do you know whether your application is running properly with minimal 
errors after [building](/web-development.html) and 
[deploying](/deployment.html) it? The fastest and easiest way
to monitor your operational [Flask web application](/flask.html) is to 
integrate one of the many available fantastic hosted 
[monitoring](/monitoring.html) tools.

In this post we will quickly add [Rollbar monitoring](https://rollbar.com)
to catch errors and visualize our application is running properly.


## Our Tools 


## Installing Dependencies

```
pip install flask==0.12.2 rollbar
```

## Running the Flask App
(error occurs but we dont see it)

## Handling Errors
(sign up for Rollbar)
(links to Python docs)

## Testing Error Handling


## What's Next?
We just learned how to catch and handle errors that occur in a simple
Flask application. Next you will want to add monitoring to your more
complicated web apps. You can also check out some of Rollbar's more 
advanced features such as:

* cool feature 1
* cool feature 2
* cool feature 3

There is a lot more to learn about [web development](/web-development.html)
and [deployments](/deployments.html) so keep learning by reading up on 
[Flask](/flask.html) and other [web frameworks](/web-frameworks.html) 
such as [Django](/django.html), [Pyramid](/pyramid.html) and 
[Sanic](/sanic.html).
