This blog post contains the slides along with a loose transcript and 
additional resources from my talk on appropriately marketing products to 
software developers that was given at 
[Silicon Valley Bank](https://www.svb.com/) during 
[Ubiquity.VC](http://www.ubiquity.vc/)'s summit for founders, investors and 
technical advisors on May 24, 2018.

Links to learn more about the concepts presented in this talk can
be found in the sidebar and at the bottom of this page.

Hey folks, my name is [Matt Makai](/about-author.html). I serve the
[Developer Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF129ioe8kc) at 
[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/). We've talked a lot today about making the 
real world programmable. We ask "what if we could modify the real world using
GitHub and Jira?" When we succeed in creating programmatic access to the 
physical world, what then? Is that the end goal?

No, that's only the beginning. We need developers to use that new 
capabilities and code with it. How do you get developers to adopt
what you are creating? That is a large question so I am going to zoom
in on just one small slice of developer relations that kicks off the
whole adoption process but that unfortunately I see upwards of 90% of
companies completely screw up: how to explain your product to
developers.

That's all for today. My name is [Matt Makai](/about-author.html)

Thank you very much.
