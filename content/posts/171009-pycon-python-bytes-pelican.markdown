[**PyCon US 2018**](https://us.pycon.org/2018/) is coming up in Cleveland, Ohio
on May 9th-17th. The call for proposals (CFP) went live in the past few 
days so now is the time to sharpen your keyboards and get into the 
proposal writing zone. 

When you start working on your proposal, here are some awesome resources 
on building a great tech talk, public speaking and describing your session
by writing a great proposal:

1. [speaking.io](http://speaking.io/)
1. [on conference speaking](https://hynek.me/articles/speaking/)

Looking forward to seeing you all at PyCon US in Cleveland early next year!


### Python Bytes podcast
Did you know Michael Kennedy of Talk Python to Me has *another* awesome
weekly Python podcast? Michael and Brian Okken of the Test and Code podcast
teamed up to create Python Bytes. I really enjoy the rapid-fire overview
of several topics within a single podcast. 

Michael and Brian were kind enough to invite me on as a co-host for the 
38th episode while Michael was on vacation. The 39th episode also had a
great discussion of Full Stack Python's Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) page.


### Pelican static site generator
Pelican is the static site generator that underpins the whole Full Stack 
Python site.

One more bit: Python for Entrepreneurs is now fully released with all 20 hours
of content. Got non-developer friends who wants you to build them an app?
Send them the Python for Entrepreneurs course so they can build it 
themselves :)
