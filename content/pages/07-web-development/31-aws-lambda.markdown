# AWS Lambda
[Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) 
is a compute service that executes arbitrary Python code in response 
to developer-defined AWS events, such as inbound API calls or file 
uploads to [AWS' Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

## Why is Lambda useful?
Lambda is often used as a "serverless" compute architecture, which 
allows developers to upload their Python code instead of spinning and
configuring servers, deploying their code and scaling based on traffic. 


## Python on AWS Lambda
Lambda only had support for JavaScript, specifically Node.JS, when it was 
first released in late 2014. Python 2 developers were welcomed to the 
platform less than a year after its release, in October 2015. Lambda now 
has support for both Python 2.7 and 3.6.
