# Text Editors and IDEs
Text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) are applications
for [writing code](/learning-programming.html). These applications are the
primary user interface for developers to create their own programs.


## Why do I need a text editor or IDE?
Where will you write your code if you do not have a text editor? Your
[development environment](/development-environments.html) must include
a text editor so you can enter, edit and delete characters to create
Python applications.

Preferrably your editor will have a monospace font. It will also get out
of your way, so no "smart" correction or automatic letter capitalization.


## What's the difference between a text editor and an IDE?
IDEs contain text editors but many text editors, for example Notepad included
with Windows, do not include IDE features. Many text editors such as
Vim or Emacs have IDE features by default but then can be further customized
to add file trees, syntax highlighting, line numbers and syntax checking 
that is commonly found in full-featured IDEs.


## Text editor implementations
The following text editor implementations can be upgraded with
configurations and plugins to become full-fledged IDEs when a developer
wants that kind of functionality.

* [Vim](/vim.html)

* [Emacs](/emacs.html)

* Sublime Text

* Windows Notepad


### IDE implementations
* PyCharm by JetBrains

* Beeware

* Wing Python IDE
