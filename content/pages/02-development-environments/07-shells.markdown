### Shell resources
* [cmd](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html) is the Pythonic
  standard library module that can be used for building your own shells.
  The [Python CmdModule wiki page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/CmdModule)
  has a great overview of the module and its capabilities.

* [Give your Python program a shell with the cmd module](https://coderwall.com/p/w78iva/give-your-python-program-a-shell-with-the-cmd-module)
  shows a short code example of how to use cmd to build a simple shell.
 
* [Super Charge Your Shell For Python Development](http://avilpage.com/2017/03/super-charge-your-shell-for-python-development.html)
  covers aliases, environment variables via 
  [Autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) and some basic
  shell commands often used during development.
