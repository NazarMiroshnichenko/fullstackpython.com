# Sublime Text
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a commonly-used text editor 
used to write Python code. Sublime Text's slick user interface along with its 
numerous extensions for syntax highlighting, source file finding and analyzing 
[code metrics](/code-metrics.html) make the editor more accessible to new
programmers than some other applications like [Vim](/vim.html) and 
[Emacs](/emacs.html).

### Python-specific Sublime Text resources
There are many Python-specific Sublime Text tutorials and resources because
the editor is so frequently used to create Python applications. The following
links should get your editor customized with linters, 
[code metrics](/code-metrics.html), syntax checking and many other 
[integrated development environment](/text-editors-ides.html) features.

many useful tutorials that are not targeted at a specific programming language
which are still useful.
