# Environment variables
Environment variables are modifiable system values that can be read 
by Python applications to affect a program's execution.


### Environment variable resources
* [Environment variables on Ubuntu Linux](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables)

* [Why you shouldn't use ENV variables for secret data](https://diogomonica.com/2017/03/27/why-you-shouldnt-use-env-variables-for-secret-data/)

* [Environment variables in Windows](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/simple-questions-what-are-environment-variables)

* One answer I found very useful when learning about getting environment
  variables in Python code is 
  [knowing the difference between os.getenv and os.environ.get](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16924471/difference-between-os-getenv-and-os-environ-get).
  Either one can be used in your applications but there are slight
  differences that can make one better than the other in various
  situations.
