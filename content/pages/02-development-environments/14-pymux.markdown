# Pymux
[Pymux](https://pypi.org/project/pymux)
([source code](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pymux)) is a
[terminal multiplexer](/terminal-multiplexers.html) implementation 
written in Python that clones the functionality of [tmux](/tmux.html).
Like tmux and [Screen](/screen.html), Pymux makes it easier for
programmers to use many shells within a single terminal window during
development.

Pymux is less frequently used than tmux but it can be useful if you 
want to customize your own terminal multiplexer environment using 
Python rather than digging into tmux's C code base.
