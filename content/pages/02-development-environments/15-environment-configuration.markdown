# Environment configuration
Properly configuring a development, test or production environment is 
important for the successful execution of your Python application.

There are many de facto names for environments:

1. Local development
1. Development / integration
1. Test
1. Staging
1. Production

The above list provides the common environment names but there
can be a limitless number and each organization has their own 
configuration.
