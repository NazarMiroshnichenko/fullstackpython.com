# Text Editors and IDEs
Text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) are applications
for [writing code](/learning-programming.html). These applications are the
primary user interface for developers to create their own programs.

[Vim](/vim.html) is an example of a text editor implementation that can be 
expanded into a full Python IDE using configuration files and plugins.

<div class="well see-also">Text editors and IDEs are a concept implemented by <a href="/vim.html">Vim</a>, <a href="/emacs.html">Emacs</a>, <a href="/sublime-text.html">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="/jupyter-notebook.html">Jupyter Notebook</a> and several other applications.

## Why is a text editor or IDE necessary?
Where will you write your code if you do not have a text editor? Your
[development environment](/development-environments.html) must include
a text editor so you can enter, edit and delete characters to create
Python applications.

Preferrably your editor will have a monospace font. It will also get out
of your way, so no "smart" correction or automatic letter capitalization.


## What's the difference between text editors and IDEs?
IDEs contain text editors but many text editors, for example Notepad included
with Windows, do not include IDE features. Many text editors such as
Vim or Emacs have IDE features by default but then can be further customized
to add file trees, syntax highlighting, line numbers and syntax checking 
that is commonly found in full-featured IDEs.


## Text editor implementations
The following text editor implementations can be upgraded with
configurations and plugins to become full-fledged IDEs when a developer
wants that kind of functionality.

* [Vim](/vim.html)

* [Emacs](/emacs.html)

* [Sublime Text](/sublime-text.html)


### IDE implementations
* PyCharm by JetBrains

* Beeware

* Wing Python IDE


### Text editor & IDE resources
* [Xi: an editor for the next 20 years](https://www.recurse.com/events/localhost-raph-levien)
  is an awesome technical talk about designing a text editor with the
  current (2018) set of tools available to a developer.
