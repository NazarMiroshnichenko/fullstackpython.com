# Jupyter Notebook
[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) 
([open source code](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)), which began 
as the iPython Notebook project, is a programming language agnostic code 
execution environment that is often used for data analysis and visualization. 
The key piece of Jupyter Notebook is a web application for creating and 
sharing documents that contain embedded code and execution results.

### Jupyter Notebook tutorials
Jupyter Notebook's powerful analysis and visualization environment can be 
intimidating even for experienced developers that are new to the tool. The
following tutorials will explain the basics so you can quickly figure out
your own productive workflow.
