# Jupyter Notebook
[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) 
([open source code](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)), which began 
as the iPython Notebook project, is a programming language agnostic code 
execution environment that is often used for data analysis and visualization. 
The key piece of Jupyter Notebook is a web application for creating and 
sharing documents that contain embedded code and execution results.
