# Data analysis
Data analysis involves a broad set of activities to clean, process and
transform a data collection to learn from it. Python is commonly used
as a programming language to perform data analysis because many tools,
such as [Jupyter Notebook](/jupyter-notebook.html), 
[pandas](/pandas.html) and [Bokeh](/bokeh.html), are written in Python 
and can be quickly applied rather than coding your own data analysis
libraries from scratch.


### Data analysis resources
* The following series on data exploration uses Python as the 
  implementation language while walking through various stages of
  how to analyze a data set.

    * [Part 1](http://blog.districtdatalabs.com/data-exploration-with-python-1)
      gives insight into how you should think about data and clarify
      what you are looking to learn.
    * [Part 2](http://blog.districtdatalabs.com/data-exploration-with-python-2)
      explains categorization and transforming a data set into one that
      is easier to analyze.
    * [Part 3](http://blog.districtdatalabs.com/data-exploration-with-python-3)
      shows how to visualize the results of your data exploration.

* [The Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
  is available to read for free online, although I also recommend
  buying the book as it is a great resource for learning the topic.

* [PyData TV](https://www.youtube.com/user/PyDataTV) contains all the
  videos from the PyData conference series. The conference talks are
  often given by professional data scientists and the developers who
  write these analysis libraries, so there is a wealth of information
  not necessarily captured anywhere else.
