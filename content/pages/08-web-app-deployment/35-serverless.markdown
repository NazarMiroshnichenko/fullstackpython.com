meta: Serverless is an deployment architecture where servers are not explicitly provisioned and code is run based on pre-defined events.


# Serverless
Serverless is an [deployment](/deployment.html) architecture where 
[servers](/servers.html) are not explicitly provisioned. Code is instead
executed based on developer-defined events, such as an incoming HTTP request 
or a new line written in a file. 

Servers still exist to execute the code but they are abstracted away from 
the developer and handled by a compute platform such as 
[Amazon Web Services Lambda](/aws-lambda.html) or 
[Google Cloud Functions](/google-cloud-functions.html).
