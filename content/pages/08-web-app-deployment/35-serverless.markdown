meta: Serverless is an deployment architecture where servers are not explicitly provisioned and code is run based on pre-defined events.


# Serverless
Serverless is an [deployment](/deployment.html) architecture where 
[servers](/servers.html) are not explicitly provisioned. Code is instead
executed based on developer-defined events as they happen, such as an 
incoming HTTP request or a new line written to a file. 


## How can code be executed "without" servers?
Servers still exist to execute the code but they are abstracted away from 
the developer and handled by a compute platform such as 
[Amazon Web Services Lambda](/aws-lambda.html) or 
[Google Cloud Functions](/google-cloud-functions.html).

### General serverless resources
Serverless concepts and implementations are still in their early
iterations so there are many ideas and good practices yet to be
discovered. These resources are the first attempts at figuring
out how to structure and operate serverless applications.
