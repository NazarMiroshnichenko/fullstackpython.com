# Google Cloud Functions
[Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/overview) 
is a [serverless](/serverless.html) compute service that executes arbitrary 
code. However, at this time Google Cloud Functions is a beta service that 
does not work with Python. 

[Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda](/aws-lambda.html) is currently a good 
alternative until Google Cloud Functions supports Python.
