# Google Cloud Functions
[Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/overview) 
is a [serverless](/serverless.html) compute service that executes arbitrary 
code. However, at this time Google Cloud Functions is a beta service that 
does not work with Python. 

[Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda](/aws-lambda.html) is currently a good 
alternative until Google Cloud Functions supports Python.

<div class="well see-also">The Google Cloud Functions service is an implementation of the <a href="/serverless.html">serverless</a> concept.

* [Serverless Cost Calculator](http://serverlesscalc.com/) estimates
  the amount that AWS would charge based on Lambda exeuctions, 
  average execution time and memory needed per execution. 

* [Microsoft Azure Functions vs. Google Cloud Functions vs. AWS Lambda](http://cloudacademy.com/blog/microsoft-azure-functions-vs-google-cloud-functions-fight-for-serverless-cloud-domination-continues/)
  gives an overview of these three serverless cloud platforms and
  compares their current capabilities.
