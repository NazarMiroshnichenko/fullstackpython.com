# Bootstrap
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is a CSS framework that makes it 
easier to create website and web application user interfaces. Bootstrap 
is especially useful as a base layer of 
[CSS](/cascading-style-sheets.html) to build sites with
[responsive web design](/responsive-design.html).
