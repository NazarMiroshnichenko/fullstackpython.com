# Companies Using Python
The Python programming language is widely used by companies around the world 
to [build web apps](/web-development.html), [analyze data](/data.html),
[automate operations via DevOps](/devops.html) and 
[create reliable, scalable enterprise applications](/enterprise-python.html).


### Large tech companies
Large technology companies tend to be polyglot (use many programming 
languages rather than standardizing on one), with Python either as a
primary language or the "glue" that helps all the other languages fit
together. The following articles explain how these leading large companies 
like Uber, Twilio, Netflix and Facebook uses Python in their development 
stacks.

* [Uber's tech stack](https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-one/) contains
  a significant amount of Python, which they documented in a series of 
  engineering posts. Part one describes the lower backend levels, which are 
  written in Python, with Node.js, Go and Java mixed in. 
  [Part two](https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-two/) explains the higher
  levels of the marketplace and user interfaces.

* [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) uses Python with [Django](/django.html)
  and the [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) content management system to power
  the amazing [Twilio documentation](https://www.twilio.com/) as well as
  [TwilioQuest](https://www.twilio.com/quest). They wrote a post about
  [how TwilioQuest was built](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/11/building-twilioquest-with-twilio-sync-django-and-vue-js.html) 
  that goes into detail on the code including the usage of the front-end 
  Vue.js framework. Twilio also uses [Flask](/flask.html) to run the 
  [REST API endpoints](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api) and open sourced
  the [Flask-RESTful](https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful) 
  framework so other developers could cut down the boilerplate in their
  web APIs.

* [Netflix uses Python](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/16/python-at-netflix) 
  throughout their organization to run chaos engineering tests and generally
  glue together the code from their high-functioning polyglot teams.

* [Facebook and Instagram use Python 3](https://thenewstack.io/instagram-makes-smooth-move-python-3/)
  at scale. They've been very vocal about successfully making the migration 
  from the [Python 2 world into Python 3](/python-2-or-3.html).

* *Increment* covers usage of Python (and other programming languages) at
  Lyft, Digital Ocean, Sauce Labs, Slack and Fastly 
  [in this awesome overview post titled "What its like to be a developer at..."](https://increment.com/development/what-its-like-to-be-a-developer-at/).


### Government agencies
Python usage in government agencies is widespread despite the reputation of
agencies as stodgy late technology adopters. Organizations range from 
financial industry regulators like the SEC and CFPB, to intelligence agencies
like the CIA, FBI and NSA.

* The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://github.com/cfpb) 
  not only uses Python for running most of their applications but also open 
  sources many of those Python projects for other agencies (or any 
  organization) to use. For example, [collab](https://github.com/cfpb/collab)
  is a [Django](/django.html) project that provides an 
  [enterprise application](/enterprise-python.html) for storing and looking 
  up information on employees and contractors.

* [NASA uses Python extensively](https://www.python.org/about/success/usa/)
  and [open sources much of their software](https://code.nasa.gov/).

* The United States 
  [Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/5y2boe/cia_uses_python_a_lot/)
  appears to be a huge fan of using Python in its state sponsored hacking 
  tools. They even published their own Python code conventions 
  documentation due to how many developers at the agency are using the
  language.

* The 
  [SEC uses Python and proposes organizations use Python to comply with regulations](http://jsdelfino.blogspot.com/2010/05/security-exchange-commission-python.html).

* A quick search for government jobs that require or recommend Python 
  [via USAJobs](https://sec.usajobs.gov/Search/?k=python&p=1) 
  turns up numerous listings at organizations such as the Smithsonian
  Institution, Department of Education, Department of the Navy and 
  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
