# Companies Using Python
The Python programming language is widely used by companies around the world 
to [build web apps](/web-development.html), [analyze data](/data.html),
[automate operations via DevOps](/devops.html) and 
[create reliable, scalable enterprise applications](/enterprise-python.html).


## Large tech companies
* [Uber's tech stack](https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-one/) contains
  a significant amount of Python, which they documented in a series of 
  engineering posts. Part one describes the lower backend levels, which are 
  written in Python, with Node.js, Go and Java mixed in. 
  [Part two](https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-two/) explains the higher
  levels of the marketplace and user interfaces.

* [Facebook and Instagram use Python 3](https://thenewstack.io/instagram-makes-smooth-move-python-3/)
  at scale. They've been very vocal about successfully making the migration 
  from the [Python 2 world into Python 3](/python-2-or-3.html).
