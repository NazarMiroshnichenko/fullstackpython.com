# Companies Using Python
The Python programming language is widely used by companies around the world 
to [build web apps](/web-development.html), [analyze data](/data.html),
[automate operations via DevOps](/devops.html) and 
[create reliable, scalable enterprise applications](/enterprise-python.html).


## Large tech companies
* [Uber's tech stack](https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-one/) contains
  a significant amount of Python, which they documented in a series of 
  engineering posts. Part one describes the lower backend levels, which are 
  written in Python, with Node.js, Go and Java mixed in. 
  [Part two](https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-two/) explains the higher
  levels of the marketplace and user interfaces.

* [Facebook and Instagram use Python 3](https://thenewstack.io/instagram-makes-smooth-move-python-3/)
  at scale. They've been very vocal about successfully making the migration 
  from the [Python 2 world into Python 3](/python-2-or-3.html).


### Government agencies
* The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://github.com/cfpb) 
  not only uses Python for running most of their applications but also open 
  sources many of those Python projects for other agencies (or any 
  organization) to use. For example, [collab](https://github.com/cfpb/collab)
  is a [Django](/django.html) project that provides an 
  [enterprise application](/enterprise-python.html) for storing and looking 
  up information on employees and contractors.

* [NASA uses Python extensively](https://www.python.org/about/success/usa/)
  and [open sources much of their software](https://code.nasa.gov/).

* The United States 
  [Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/5y2boe/cia_uses_python_a_lot/)
  appears to be a huge fan of using Python in its state sponsored hacking 
  tools. They even published their own Python code conventions 
  documentation due to how many developers at the agency are using the
  language.
