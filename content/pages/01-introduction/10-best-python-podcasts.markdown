# Best Python Podcasts
The [Python community](/python-community.html) produces an incredible wealth 
of free and low cost resources for both new and experienced software 
developers. These great resources include several Python podcasts that are 
released on a regular schedule.

Note that podcasts that have not been updated in the past twelve months 
are not included on this page.


## Favorite podcast episodes
Here are a list of my favorite episodes from various Python podcasts before 
we dive into entire podcast recommendations in the next section. Dig into
these episodes to get a feel for various personalities and styles in
podcast presentation.

* [SQLAlchemy and data access in Python](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/5/sqlalchemy-and-data-access-in-python)
  brought me some much-needed context and understanding for how the 
  [object-relational mapping](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html) library
  [SQLAlchemy](/sqlalchemy.html) evolved. This episode interviews 
  SQLAlchemy's creator. The show host, Michael Kennedy, asks great questions 
  based on his in-depth research and prior usage of SQLAlchemy.

* [Deploying Python Web Applications](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/26/deploying-python-web-applications-updated).
  *Spoiler alert*: this is the episode I was on Talk Python to Me explaining
  how [Python web application deployments](/deployment.html) work.


## Python-specific podcasts
* [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm) focuses on the
  people and organizations coding on Python. Each episode features a
  different guest interviewee to talk about his or her work.

* [Podcast.\_\_init\_\_](http://podcastinit.com/) is another regular podcast 
  that presents stories about Python and interviews "with the people who 
  make it great".

* [Test and Code Podcast](http://pythontesting.net/test-podcast/) focuses
  on [testing](/testing.html) and related topics such as mocking and 
  [code metrics](/code-metrics.html).

* [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/) is a new podcast from the creators
  of the above mentioned "Talk Python to Me" and "Test and Code Podcast".

* [Import This](https://www.kennethreitz.org/import-this/) is an occasional
  podcast from Ken Reitz and Alex Gaynor with very in-depth interviews with
  influential Python community members.

* Professor Philip Guo has a video podcast called 
  [PG Podcast](http://pgbovine.net/PG-Podcast.htm), typically on 
  Python subjects. 
  [All episodes are listed on a separate page](http://pgbovine.net/PG-Podcast-summary.htm).

## General software development podcasts
* [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/)
  incredibly has a podcast every day with a different developer on a
  huge range of relevant development subjects.

* [DataFramed](https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast) is a data
  science podcast that often covers Python libraries and other areas of
  interest to people using Python to analyze [data](/data.html).

* [All things Git](https://www.allthingsgit.com/) talks to developers
  using, building and working with Git with new episodes every two weeks.

* [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) interviews developers
  who are early in their software development journey to find out their
  stories of why they are programming and what they are working on. There
  are also interviews with experienced developers building well-known
  projects.

* [Command_line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes)
  covers [operating system](/operating-systems.html)-level topics as
  well as [DevOps](/devops.html).

* [Embedded.fm](http://embedded.fm/) goes into embedded systems and
  hardware hacking.

* [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/) is a weekly podcast on
  general software development matters.

* [Full Stack Radio](http://www.fullstackradio.com/). No relation to 
  Full Stack Python but another one to check out!

* [Exponent](http://exponent.fm/) is not a software development podcast
  but it covers the intersection of corporate strategy and technology in an
  in-depth way that allows me to better understand the decisions businesses
  make when building and releasing software. I listen to every episode 
  (at 1.5x speed) and it's well worth the 45 to 60 minutes spent 
  listening to Ben Thompson and James Allworth go deep on a weekly topic.
