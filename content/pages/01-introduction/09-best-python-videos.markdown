# Best Python Videos
If you prefer to learn Python programming by watching videos then this is the
resource for you. I've watched hundreds of live technical talks and combed
through videos to pick out the ones with great speakers who'll teach you the
most about the language and ecosystem. 

This page links to the best free videos as well as other video lists so you 
can do your own searching through the huge backlog of conference and meetup 
talks from the past several years. 

<div class="well see-also">Be sure to read the <a href="/best-python-resources.html">best Python resources</a> for links to books and articles as well as <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a> to learn more about web development.</div>


## Web development with Django, Flask and other frameworks
* [Kate Heddleston](https://twitter.com/heddle317) gave a talk at PyCon 2014 
  called 
  "[Full-stack Python Web Applications](http://pyvideo.org/video/2591/so-you-want-to-be-a-full-stack-developer-how-to)"
  with clear visuals for how numerous layers of the Python web
  stack fit together. There are also [slides available from the talk](https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2014/so-you-want-to-be-a-full-stack-developer-how-to-build-a-full-stack-python-web-application-by-kate-heddleston)
  with all the diagrams.

* My [EuroPython 2014 "Full Stack Python"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6NaOKD40rY)
  talk goes over each topic from this guide and provides context for how the
  pieces fit together. 
  The [talk slides](http://www.mattmakai.com/presentations/2014-full-stack-python-berlin.html) are also available.

* All of [EuroPython 2016's talks are available on a YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8uoeex94UhE3FDvjacSlHFffoNEoPzzm).

* Kate Heddleston and I gave a talk at DjangoCon 2014 called

  first Django website.

  a detailed Flask tutorial on video with corresponding code examples on 
  GitHub.

* [Designing Django's Migrations](http://pyvideo.org/video/2630/designing-djangos-migrations)
  covers Django 1.7's new migrations from the main programmer 
  of South and now Django's built-in migrations, Andrew Godwin.

## Core Python language videos
* Jessica McKellar's 
  [Building and breaking a Python sandbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL_syMmRkoU)
  is a fascinating walk through the lower layers of the Python interpreter.

* Brandon Rhodes' 
  [All Your Ducks In A Row: Data Structures in the Std Lib and Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYlnfvKVDoM)
  goes through how data structures are implemented, how to select a
  data structure appropriate to your application and how the list and 
  dictionary can be used in many situations.

* The talk [Python Descriptors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdvpNaWwx24) 
  by Simeon Franklin explains the what and why of this core Python language 
  feature.

* David Beazley gives an amazing live coded performance to show
  [Python concurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4)
  using threads, event loops and coroutines. David makes the live coding
  look easy but a whole lot of work must've gone into that talk.

* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) contains
  lecture videos and exercises for learning Python.


## Video compilations
* [PyVideo](http://pyvideo.org/) organizes and indexes thousands of Python
  videos from both major conferences and meetups.

* [Incredible Technical Speakers](https://github.com/mattmakai/incredible-technical-speakers)
  is a repository I put together that features software developer speakers
  talking about programming language agnostic topics. The list is intended
  to emphasize professional software developers who also have the ability to
  engage an audience of peers with an exciting talk.
