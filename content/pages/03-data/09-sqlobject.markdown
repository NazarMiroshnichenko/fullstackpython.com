meta: SQLObject is an object-relational mapper (ORM) library for Python applications.


# SQLObject
[SQLObject](http://www.sqlobject.org/) 
([source code](https://github.com/sqlobject/sqlobject)) 
is an
[object-relational mapping layer (ORM)](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html)
which can retrieve and modify Python [application data](/data.html) from  
[relational databases](/databases.html) such as [SQLite](/sqlite.html),
[PostgreSQL](/postgresql.html) and [MySQL](/mysql.html). It has been under 
active open source development for over 14 years, since
[before 2003](http://sqlobject.org/News1.html#sqlobject-0-5).

<div class="well see-also">SQLObject is an implementation of the <a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mapping (ORM)</a> concept. Learn more in the <a href="/data.html">data</a> chapter or view <a href="/table-of-contents.html">all topics</a>.</div>


### SQLObject resources
SQLObject has been around for a long time as an open source project but
unfortunately there are not that many tutorials for it. The following
talks and posts will get you started. If you take an interest in the project
and write additional resources, file an 
[issue ticket](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/issues)
so we can get them added to this list.

* This post on
  [Object-Relational Mapping with SQLObject](http://www.andypatterns.com/index.php/blog/object_relational_mapping_pattern_-_using_sqlobj/)
  explains the concept behind ORMs and shows the Python code for how they
  can be used.

* Ian Bicking presented on SQLObject back in 2004 with a talk on
  [SQLObject and Database Programming in Python](http://www.ianbicking.org/docs/sqlobject-presentation/sqlobject-and-database-programming.html).

* [Connecting databases to Python with SQLObject](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-pythonsqlo/index.html)
  is an older post but still relevant with getting started basics.
