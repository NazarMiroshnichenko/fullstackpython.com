meta: Markup languages allow annotations on text documents where the syntax is different and parsable from the plain text.


# Markup Languages
Markup languages provide pre-defined, parsable syntax within text documents 
that is used for annotations. For example, within a [Markdown](/markdown.html)
document, the syntax 
`[this is a link to Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com)`
indicates the text "this is a link to Full Stack Python" should be annotated
with a link to "https://www.fullstackpython.com/" when run through a Markdown 
parser and then transformed into HTML output.

  less easily adopted LaTeX for creating documents.
