# NumPy
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) ([source code](https://github.com/numpy/numpy))
is a Python code library that adds scientific computing capabilities such as
N-dimensional array objects, FORTRAN and C++ code integration, linear algebra
and Fourier transformations. NumPy serves as a required dependency for many
other scientific computing packages such as [pandas](/pandas.html).

### Example NumPy code
* [SmoothLife](https://github.com/duckythescientist/SmoothLife) is an 
  implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/)
  using NumPy. The project uses a continuous space rather than the 
  traditional discrete board.
