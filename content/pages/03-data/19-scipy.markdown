meta: SciPy is an umbrella project for many open source data analysis libraries such as NumPy, pandas and Matplotlib.


# SciPy
[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) is a collection of open source code libraries 
for math, science and engineering. [NumPy](/numpy.html), 
[Matplotlib](/matplotlib.html) and [pandas](/pandas.html) are libraries
that fall under the SciPy project umbrella.

[Blaze](http://blaze.pydata.org/) is a similar, but separate, ecosystem 
with additional tools for wrangling, cleaning, processing and analyzing data.


### SciPy resources
Take a look at the individual pages for [NumPy](/numpy.html), 
[Matplotlib](/matplotlib.html) and [pandas](/pandas.html) for tutorials
specific to those projects. The following resources are broader walkthroughs
for the SciPy ecosystem:

* [SciPy Lecture notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/) goes into the 
  overall Python scientific computing ecosystem and how to use it.

* The [SciPy Cookbook](http://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/) contains
  instructions for various SciPy packages that were previously hosted
  on the SciPy wiki.

* [Lectures in Quantitative Economics: SciPy](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/scipy.html)
  provides a good overview of SciPy compared to the specific NumPy
  project, as well as explanations for the wrappers SciPy provides 
  over lower-level FORTRAN libraries.

* [A plea for stability in the SciPy ecosystem](http://blog.khinsen.net/posts/2017/11/16/a-plea-for-stability-in-the-scipy-ecosystem/)
  presents concerns from one scientist's perspective about how fast the 
  Python programming ecosystem changes and that code can become backwards 
  incompatible in only a few years. The issue is that many science projects
  last decades and therefore cannot follow the rate of change as easily
  as typical software development projects.
