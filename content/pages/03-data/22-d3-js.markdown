### d3.js tutorials
d3.js has a steep learning curve so it is a good idea to read several 
tutorials before diving in and trying to create your own visualization
from scratch.

* [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to d3.js](https://medium.com/@enjalot/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-d3-js-a8552174733a)
  is a wonderfully-written resource that explains the context for how
  d3.js works and how all the pieces can be used to create your desired
  visualizations.

* [d3.js first steps](https://www.dashingd3js.com/d3js-first-steps)
  contains the code and markup for building your first d3.js visual.

* [Let's Make a D3 Plugin](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/d3-plugin/) shows
  you how to create your own reusable plugin that you can use across
  multiple visualizations as a separate JavaScript library. d3.js 
  version 4 is now widely used so don't worry about the note at the
  start of the article.

* [Reusable and extendable d3 charts](https://537.io/reusable-and-extendable-d3-charts/)
  is a natural extension of the d3 plugin post. It shows how to reuse
  visualization code between multiple visuals.

* [Visualizing Movement Data - Part I](https://omid.al/posts/2016-08-23-MocapVis-D3.html)
  provides a detailed example of how to draw a complex visualization.

* This [Fantasy Map Generator](https://bl.ocks.org/Azgaar/b845ce22ea68090d43a4ecfb914f51bd)
  is such a cool example of what d3.js can procedurally generate based on 
  a set of inputs.

* [Building dashboards with Django and D3](http://www.dreisbach.us/blog/building-dashboards-with-django-and-d3/)

* [Argyle](http://bl.ocks.org/veltman/f24fba4f6549639cacfd4d0a50e9d4b8) in
  d3? Oh yes, the library can do that, and here is the code to prove it.


### Charts with d3.js
* [Responsive D3js Charts](http://ablesense.com/responsive-d3js-charts/)
  shows how to take a static line chart and make it 
  [responsive](/responsive-design.html) when the browser size changes.

* [Resize to Scale with d3.js](http://www.thesoftwaresimpleton.com/blog/2015/11/16/resize-d3/)
  gives code for a render function that adjusts the size of the viewing
  window based on the parent element for the visualization.

* [Make great-looking d3.js charts in Python without coding a line of JavaScript](http://dataviztalk.blogspot.com/2016/01/make-great-looking-d3js-charts-in.html)
  combines a Python backend with the 
  [python-nvd3](https://github.com/areski/python-nvd3) library to
  generate d3.js charts without having to hand-write the JavaScript code.
