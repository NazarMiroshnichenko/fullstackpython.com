  <p>You're knee deep in learning <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
  programming. The syntax is starting to make sense. The first
  few <em>ahh-ha!</em> moments hit you as you learn to use 
  conditional statements, <code>for</code> loops and classes while 
  coding with the open source libraries that make Python such an 
  amazing programming ecosystem.</p>
  <p>Now you want to take your
  <a href="/learning-programming.html">initial Python knowledge</a>
  and make something real, like a web application to show off to friends or 
  sell as a service to customers. That's where 
  <a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/table-of-contents.html">Full Stack Python</a> 
  comes in. You have come to the right place to learn everything you
  need to <a href="/web-development.html">create</a>, 
  <a href="/deployment.html">deploy</a> and <a href="/devops.html">operate</a> 
  Python-powered applications.</p>
  <p>This guide branches out on topic because your learning
  requirements depend on what you're working on. Select one
  of the buttons below or check out the full
