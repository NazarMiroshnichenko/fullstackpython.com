# The Full Stack Python Blog
Full Stack Python began way back in December 2012 when I started writing
the initial [deployment](/deployment.html), [server](/servers.html), 
operating system, web server and WSGI server pages. Since then, the pages
have expanded out into a 
[boatload of other areas](http://www.fullstackpython.com/table-of-contents.html)
including subjects outside the deployment topics I originally started the
site to explain.

Frequently though I wanted to write a Python walkthrough that wasn't a
good fit for the page format I use for each topic.
