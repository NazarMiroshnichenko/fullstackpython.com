# Best Python Resources
The Python community is amazing at sharing detailed resources and helping
beginners learn to program with the language. There's so many resources
out there though that it can be difficult to know how to find them. 

This page aggregates the absolute best Python resources and explains from
my biased perspective the best way to use each one. This is the list I wish
I had when I was learning the language.


## New to programming
* To get an introduction to both Python and Django at the same time, purchase
  [Real Python](http://www.realpython.com/) by Fletcher, Michael, and Jeremy.

* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) is a
  free book by Zed Shaw.

* I wrote a quick blog post on
  [learning Python](http://www.mattmakai.com/learning-python-for-non-developers.html)
  that non-technical folks trying to learn to program may find useful.

* The O'Reilly book 
  [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html)
  is available in HTML form for free on the web.


## Experienced developers new to Python
* [Learn Python in y minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)
  provides a whirlwind tour of the Python language. The guide is especially
  useful if you're coming in with previous software development experience
  and want to quickly grasp how the language is structured.

* [Python for you and me](http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is an
  approachable book with sections for Python syntax and the major language 
  constructs. The book also contains a short guide at the end to get
  programmers to write their first Flask web application.

* Kenneth Reitz's 
  [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/)
  contains a wealth of information both on the Python programming as well
  as the community.


## Beyond the basics
* [Neckbeard Republic](https://www.neckbeardrepublic.com/) provides free 
  screencasts for learning intermediate topics. I typically prefer to learn
  by reading. However, these videos are helpful in seeing the code on the 
  screen instead of just looking at static code snippets.

* The [Python Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/python) rolls up great
  Python links and has an active community ready to answer questions from
  beginners and advanced Python developers alike.


## Newsletters
* [Python Weekly](http://www.pythonweekly.com/) is a free weekly roundup
  of the latest Python articles, videos, projects, and upcoming events.

* [PyCoder's Weekly](http://pycoders.com/) is another great free weekly
  email newsletter similar to Python Weekly. The best resources are generally
  covered in both newsletters but they often cover different articles
  and projects from around the web.
