# Bottle
[Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) is a WSGI-compliant
[single source file](https://github.com/defnull/bottle/blob/master/bottle.py)
web framework with no external dependencies except for the standard library
included with Python.


## Bottle resources
* The [official Bottle tutorial](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html) 
  provides a thorough view of basic concepts and features for the framework.

* Digital Ocean provides an extensive [introductory post on Bottle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-the-bottle-micro-framework-to-develop-python-web-apps).

* This tutorial provides a walkthrough for
[getting started with Bottle](http://www.giantflyingsaucer.com/blog/?p=3598).

* Here's a short code snippet for 
  [creating a RESTful API with Bottle and MongoDB](http://myadventuresincoding.wordpress.com/2011/01/02/creating-a-rest-api-in-python-using-bottle-and-mongodb/).

* This [tutorial](http://gotofritz.net/blog/weekly-challenge/restful-python-api-bottle/) 
  is another Bottle walkthrough for creating a RESTful web API.

* [BAM! A Web Framework "Short Stack"](http://reachtim.com/articles/BAM-Short-Stack.html)

  application using the framework.
