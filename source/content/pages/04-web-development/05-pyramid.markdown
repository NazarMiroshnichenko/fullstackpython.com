# Pyramid
[Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about) is an open 
source [WSGI](/wsgi-servers.html) web framework based on the 
Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

  is a good place to start getting your hands dirty with example projects.

  [rapid development projects](http://www.sixfeetup.com/blog/pyramid-for-rapid-development-projects)
  in that blog post.
