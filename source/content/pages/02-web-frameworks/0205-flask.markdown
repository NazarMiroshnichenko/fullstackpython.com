# Flask
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a Python microframework deliberately 
built with a 
[small core and easy-to-extend philosophy](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/design/). 
Flask is generally considered more 
[Pythonic](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/58968/what-defines-pythonian-or-pythonic) 
than Django because Flask web application code is often more
explicit. Flask was also written several years after Django and therefore
learned from the Python community's reactions as the framework evolved.
Jökull Sólberg wrote a great piece articulating to this effect in his 
[experience switching between Flask and Django](http://jokull.calepin.co/my-flask-to-django-experience.html).


## Flask resources
The 18-part Flask mega tutorial is an absolutely amazing starting 
resource for using the Flask framework. Yes, there are a lot of posts in 
the series. However, each post is focused on a single topic to contain 
the complexity while the reader is learning the framework. The whole 
series is well worth an in-depth read-through. The 
[author](https://twitter.com/miguelgrinberg) is also writing the 
[O'Reilly Flask Web Development](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031116.do)
book so consider picking that up as well.

* The [Flask Extensions Registry](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/) is a
  curated list of the best packages that extend Flask. It's the first location
  to look through when you're wondering how to do something that's not in the
  core framework.

* Randall Degges wrote a detailed walkthrough for 
  [building a Flask app in 30 minutes](https://stormpath.com/blog/build-a-flask-app-in-30-minutes/).

* Nice post by Jeff Knupp on [Productionizing a Flask App](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/01/29/productionizing-a-flask-application/).

* [Building Websites in Python with Flask](http://maximebf.com/blog/2012/10/building-websites-in-python-with-flask/#.U06EZ-ZdW4J)
  is another walkthrough tutorial from first steps through 
  [getting bigger with Flask](http://maximebf.com/blog/2012/11/getting-bigger-with-flask/).


* The Plank & Whittle blog has two posts, one on 
  [Packaging a Flask web app](http://www.plankandwhittle.com/packaging-a-flask-web-app/) 
  and another on 
  [Packaging a Flask app in a Debian package](http://www.plankandwhittle.com/packaging-a-flask-app-in-a-debian-package/)
  once you've built an app and want to deploy it.

* The Tuts+ [Flask tutorial](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-pythons-flask-framework--net-28822) 
  is another great walkthrough for getting started with the framework.

* [Flask by Example: Part 1](http://www.realpython.com/blog/python/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/)
  shows the basic first steps for setting up a Flask project.


## Flask projects
* [Flask Foundation](https://github.com/JackStouffer/Flask-Foundation) is a
  starting point for new Flask projects.
