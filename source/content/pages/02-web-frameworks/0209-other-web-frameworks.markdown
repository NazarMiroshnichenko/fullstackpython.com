Python has a significant number of web frameworks outside the usual Django,
Flask and Bottle suspects.

## Pyramid
The [Pyramid framework](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) stems from the Pylons
project which develops a set of open source web application frameworks. 
Pyramid applications are built using a model-view-controller architecture.


## Falcon

with web application speed as a top priority.


## [Morepath](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
