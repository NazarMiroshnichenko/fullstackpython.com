# Other Web Frameworks
Python has a significant number of web frameworks outside the usual Django,
Flask and Bottle suspects.


## Pyramid
The [Pyramid framework](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) stems from the Pylons
project which develops a set of open source web application frameworks. 
Pyramid applications are built using a model-view-controller architecture.


## Falcon
[Falcon](http://falconframework.org/) is a minimalist web framework designed
with web application speed as a top priority.


## Morepath
[Morepath](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is a micro web 
framework that routes URLs directly to model code.


## web.py
[web.py](http://webpy.org/) is a Python web framework designed for simplicity
in building web applications.


## web2py
[Web2py](http://www.web2py.com/) is a batteries-included philosophy framework
with project structure based on model-view-controller patterns.


## Other web framework resources
* This [roundup of 14 minimal Python frameworks](http://codecondo.com/14-minimal-web-frameworks-for-python/)
  contains both familiar and less known Python libraries.

* The [web micro-framework battle](http://www.slideshare.net/r1chardj0n3s/web-microframework-battle/)
  presentation goes over Bottle, Flask, and many other lesser known Python
  web frameworks.


## Other frameworks learning checklist
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Read through the web frameworks listed above and check out their project
websites. 

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
It's useful to know what other web frameworks exist besides Django and Flask.
However, when you're just starting to learn to program there are significantly 
more tutorials and resources for [Django](/django.html) and 
[Flask](/flask.html) on the web. My recommendation is to start with one of
those two frameworks then expand your knowledge from there.
