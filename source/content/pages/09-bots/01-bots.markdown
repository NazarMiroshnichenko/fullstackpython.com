# Bots
Bots are software programs that combine requests, which are typically 
provided as text, with contextual data, such as geolocation and payment 
information, to appropriately handle the request and respond. Bots are
often also called "chatbots", "assistants" or "agents."


## Bots resources
* The Economist wrote a general piece on 
  [why bots look like they'll gain adoption in various market segments](http://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21696477-market-apps-maturing-now-one-text-based-services-or-chatbots-looks-poised).
  The piece doesn't have much technical depth but it's a good overview of
  how some businesses are looking at the opportunity.

* [Bots won't replace apps](http://dangrover.com/blog/2016/04/20/bots-wont-replace-apps.html)
  is a fantastic piece by WeChat's product manager on how text-based bots 
  alone typically do not provide a good user experience. Instead, chat
  apps with automated responses, user data and basic web browser 
  functionality are what has allowed bot concepts to bloom in Asian markets.
  There's a lot of good information in this post to unpack.

* [How to write a Slack bot in Python](https://medium.com/@julianmartinez/how-to-write-a-slack-bot-with-python-code-examples-4ed354407b98)
  is a solid code tutorial for building your first bot on the Slack
  platform.
