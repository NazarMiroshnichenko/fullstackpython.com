# Vim
Vim, shorthand for Vi IMproved, is a text editor with numerous configuration 
options and wide-ranging extensions that can be used to write Python code.


## Why is Vim a good Python development environment?
Vim's philosophy is that developers are fastest when they never take their 
hands off the keys. Even using the mouse is a detriment to the rate at which
your thoughts can flow into code. 

Vim has a language behind its commands. When a beginner is learning the
editor she may feel like it is impossible to understand all the key commands.
However, the commands stack together in a logical way so that over time
the editor becomes predictable.


## General Vim resources
* [Learn Vim Progressively](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/)
  is a wonderful tutorial that follows the path I took when learning Vim:
  learn just enough to survive with it as your day-to-day editor then begin 
  adding more advanced commands on top.

* [A vim Tutorial and Primer](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/) is an
  incredibly deep study in how to go from beginner to knowledgeable in Vim.

* [Vim as Your IDE](http://haridas.in/vim-as-your-ide.html) discusses how to
  set up Vim for greater productivity once you learn the initial Vim language 
  for using the editor.

* [Vim as a Language](http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/)
  explains the language syntax and how you can build up over time to master
  the editor.

* In [Vim: revisited](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2011/12/vim-revisited/) the
  author explains his on-again off-again relationship with using Vim. He then
  shows how he configures and uses the editor so it sticks as his primary
  code editting tool.
