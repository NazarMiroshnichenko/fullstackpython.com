# Future Directions
Full Stack Python is a larger undertaking than I originally envisioned. My
original intent was to link to the best resources by category. That grew into
explaining the concepts plus including the best links I could find.

This short section lays out my thoughts on what I'm working to improve in the
intermediate-to-long term. Full Stack Python is my main 2014 project so I want 
to make it a comprehensive "complete" reference for Python developers by the
end of the year.

These plans can change based on 
[pull requests](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/pulls)
from the community. I work to integrate PRs within a day or two so please 
submit one when you see a fix or improvement that needs to be made!

Here are some things I'm actively working on:

* Testing an idea for "choose your own adventure"-style navigation through
  the site.

* Clear, concise descriptions for each concept in every section along with
  the "why [x] is needed"

* Flesh out [JavaScript](../javascript.html), 
  [Configuration Management](../configuration-management.html), 
  [API Integration](../api-integration.html),
  and [Web Security](../web-application-security.html) sections.
