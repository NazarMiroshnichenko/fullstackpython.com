# Future Directions
Full Stack Python is a larger undertaking than I originally envisioned. My
original intent was to link to the best resources by category. That grew into
explaining the concepts plus including the best links I could find.

This short section lays out my thoughts on what I'm working to improve in the
intermediate-to-long term. Full Stack Python is my main 2014 project so I want 
to make it a comprehensive "complete" reference for Python developers by the
end of the year.

These plans can change based on 
[pull requests](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/pulls)
from the community. I work to integrate PRs within a day or two so please 
submit one when you see a fix or improvement that needs to be made!

Here are some things I'm actively working on:

* Add one more section for building and exposing APIs.

* Clear, concise descriptions for each concept in every section along with
  the "why [x] is needed"

* Flesh out [JavaScript](../javascript.html), 
  [Configuration Management](../configuration-management.html), 
  [API Integration](../api-integration.html),
  and [Web Security](../web-application-security.html) sections.

* Create learning checklists for every section where it makes sense. The
  remaining sections that need checklists are 

    1. API integration
    1. static content
    1. caching
    1. logging
    1. web analytics
    1. web application security


### That's what coming. What would you like to learn right now?
