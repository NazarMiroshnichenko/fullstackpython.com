# Future Directions
Full Stack Python is a larger undertaking than I originally envisioned. My
original intent was to link to the best resources by category. That grew into
explaining the concepts plus including the best links I could find.

This short section lays out my thoughts on what I'm working to improve in the
intermediate-to-long term. Full Stack Python is my main 2014 project so I want 
to make it a comprehensive "complete" reference for Python developers by the
end of the year.

These plans can change based on 
[pull requests](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/pulls)
from the community. I work to integrate PRs within a day or two so please 
submit one when you see a fix or improvement that needs to be made!

Here are some things I'm actively working on:

* Update these sections with better explanations and resources: 

    1. [Source control](/source-control.html)
    1. [Configuration management](/configuration-management.html)
    1. [JavaScript](/javascript.html)
    1. [API integration](/api-integration.html)
    1. [API creation](/api-creation.html)
    1. [Caching](/caching.html)
    1. [Web security](/web-application-security.html)


After those updates are done I'll go back through and apply visuals to
each section to make them easier to read and understand.


### That's what coming. What would you like to learn right now?
