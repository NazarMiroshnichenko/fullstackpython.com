# Change Log
This is a running list of the major changes to Full Stack Python since its
inception in December 2012. Another way to view the modifications is through
the 
[source repository's commit log](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/commits/gh-pages) on GitHub.

## 2014
### May
* Added link to my O'Reilly Programming blog post on demand for full stack 
  developer capabilities.
* Updated APIs page with basic information on webhooks.
* Added learning checklist for source control, application dependencies,
  configuration management, NoSQL data stores, APIs, API integration and
  API creation sections.
* Moving learning checklists to the bottom of the pages since they are 
  specific advice for steps to take after reading a section.
* Added a stub section for APIs.
* Cleaned up and polished the task queues and web analytics pages.
* Added learning checklist to operating systems, web servers, task queues,
  monitoring pages and WSGI servers.
* Adding more logging resources.
* Continuing to add learning checklists to sections such as servers.
* Moving navigation options into meta tags on markdown pages.

### April
* Adding the concept of "learning checklists" to web frameworks, Django, CSS
  and JavaScript pages to give readers some guidance for how to learn each 
  topic. Will expand these checklists out into other pages over the next 
  couple of weeks.
* Added an email sign up form to determine how many people are interested in
  a full book since I've had a lot of requests in person to write one.
* Added new resources to the other web frameworks section.
* Updated the way choices to go from one page to another are generated. It's
  now done off metadata instead of duplicated HTML content.
* Huge site update to reorganize the way content is presented and navigated.
  Kinda has that "choose your own adventure" thing going for it, doesn't it?
* New logo! This one's way more Python software stack, way less boring 
  folder-thingy. Here's how the old one looked in comparison:

* Added a [future direction](../future-directions.html) section to explain
  current priorities for further developments on the site.
* More resources for web frameworks and configuration management sections.
* Added small JavaScript section. Updating witih basic resources.
* Updated application dependencies with new links to Python library 
  collections.
* Merged a couple of awesome pull requests that fixed typos and added 
  additional Bottle resources.

### March
* Updated logging page with new resources.
* Added new CSS page.
* New intermediate learning links on the best resources page.
* Updated task queues page with better explanations and many more curated
  resources.
* Added why is this piece necessary for databases, WSGI servers, web 
  frameworks and application dependencies.
* Updating best resources page with newsletters and a few additional beyond
  the basics resources.
* Adding 'why is this necessary' sections to servers, operating systems,
  and web servers pages.
* Extracting best Python resources from the introduction into a separate
  page.
* Cleaned up links on the first ten chapters and added new resources for
  web frameworks.
* Updated application dependencies section with new resources and initial
  content description.
* Updated the change log (how meta!) to have a cleaner layout.

  [GitHub repo pull requests](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/pulls)). 
* New resources for platform-as-a-service section. 
* Added new sections specified by the community as missing. 
* Reorganized ordering of content. 
* Broke out subsections for Django and Flask. 
* Added signficant content to the WSGI section. 
* Converted from RST to Markdown (some of the downstream tools I want to 
  use work better with Markdown than RST). 
* Reorganized content into rough outline of "final" chapters.

### January

  control sections. 
* Updated about section.

  introduction, CDN, web frameworks, and database sections with stubs for 
  other areas.

That's the whole history of Full Stack Python. What do you want to learn now?
