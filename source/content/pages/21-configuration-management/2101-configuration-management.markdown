# Configuration Management
Configuration management involves modifying servers from an existing state to 
a desired state. Numerous tools exist to modify the state in a controlled 
way, including [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet), 
[Chef](http://www.getchef.com/chef/), 
[SaltStack](http://www.saltstack.com/), and Ansible. Puppet and Chef are
written in Ruby, while SaltStack and Ansible are written in Python.


## Ansible
[Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com/) is an open source configuration
management and application deployment tool built in Python.
