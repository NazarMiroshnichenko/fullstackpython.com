# Future Directions
Full Stack Python has completely blown away my expectations for what I could
accomplish with a side project. I really appreciate all the in-person feedback,
emails and pull requests I've received from the community. Keep them coming!

For 2015 I'm building out the scope of the site beyond web development into
core Python concepts, data analysis and visualization and some hardware 
hacking such as with the Raspberry Pi and Arduino Yun.

The biggest update though will be the Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments,
an in-progress step-by-step tutorial ebook for learning how to deploy Python
web applications.

Note that these plans can change based on 
[pull requests](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/pulls)
from the community. I work to integrate PRs within a day or two so please 
submit one when you see a fix or improvement that needs to be made!


### That's what coming. What would you like to learn right now?
