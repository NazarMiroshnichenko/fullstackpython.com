# Change Log
This is a running list of the major changes to Full Stack Python since its
inception in December 2012. Another way to view the modifications is through
the 
[source repository's commit log](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/commits/gh-pages) on GitHub.


## 2015
### June
* Added a new page on Python
  [object-relational mappers](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html), which
  helped condense that information on a single page and lighten the loads on
  the Django and relational databases pages.
* Added new page with a little advice on 
  [learning programming](/learning-programming.html).
* Proofread and tweaked the [web frameworks](/web-frameworks.html) page.
* Added a new section entitled "Do I have to use a web framework?" to the
  [web frameworks](/web-frameworks.html) page.
* Reviewed and updated the [introduction](/introduction.html) with slight
  modifications.
* Added new [Docker](/docker.html) resources.
* Made some changes to what is contained in the Markdown files versus the
  HTML Jinja2 templates. Behind the scenes work that needed to be done to
  move the project forward.
* Work continues on the 
  [Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments](http://www.deploypython.com/) book.

### May
* Got a whole lot of work done on my upcoming 
  [Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments](http://www.deploypython.com/) book.
  Very close to releasing it (looking at mid-June).
* Added new [Django](/django.html) resources, especially around migrations
  in Django 1.7+.
* Worked on making [Why Use Python?](/why-use-python.html) page specific to
  that topic now that the [Enterprise Python](/enterprise-python.html) page
  contains enterprise-y info.
* New page on the super broad topic of [Data](/data.html) with Python.
  Eventually it'll link to all sorts of data topics such as analysis,
  visualization and processing.
* New page on [Enterprise Python](/enterprise-python.html). A bit op-ed-ish
  perhaps, but I think it captures some of the spirit of the open source
  ecosystem with regards to Python for enterprise software development.
* Added additional [Django](/django.html) resources, specifically related to
  testing.

### April
* Added more [NoSQL resources](/no-sql-datastore.html), especially ones involving
  Redis.
* New [Pyramid](/pyramid.html) resource where the primary author is 
  interviewed about the web framework.
* New [Vim](/vim.html) resources.
* Updated the [Django](/django.html) page with new resources. The page is
  getting unwieldy at its current size so I'll likely pare it down with
  better categorizes sometime soon.
* Added new resources on the [Flask](/flask.html) page.

### March
* Added new [source control](/source-control.html) resources.
* Major site performance improvements. I removed font awesome and replaced
  icons with SVG elements that mimic the font awesome icons.
* Pushed the [1000th commit](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/commit/2fc711b44ffed89c9855f4f999d4c1df076bc44d) 
  to Full Stack Python!

* Major update to [Vim](/vim.html) page to add screenshots, a better example
  .vimrc configuration and many more resources.
* Updated the [web analytics](/web-analytics.html) page with a new 
  Python-specific section for walkthroughs that are specific to building or
  using analytics with Python applications.
* Adding a slew of new [Django](/django.html) resources.
* Working on including Crossbar.io and Autobahn to the 
  [websockets](/websockets.html) page.
* Added the Muffin framework to the 
  [other web frameworks](/other-web-frameworks.html) page.
* Added new [Emacs](/emacs.html) page based on 
  [pull request #49](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/pull/49) 
  base information. Thank you!
* Added a new page on [best Python videos](/best-python-videos.html) that 
  breaks out all the videos I had scattered around the site and puts the
  best ones in a single place.
* Beefing up the Django resources and will soon break them further down 
  into subcategories so they are easier to find by topic.

### February
* Cleaned up the sidebar and [email](/email.html) subscribe messaging.
* Added new [monitoring](/monitoring.html), [websockets](/websockets.html) and
  [continuous integration](/continuous-integration.html) resources.
* New [Django](/django.html) resources.
* Updated the [Vim](/vim.html) page with a Vimrc configuration file 
  explanation along with Vimrc resources.
* Added a [generators](/generators.html) page that's mostly a stub that I will
  be building out to explain this core language feature.
* Updated [table of contents](/table-of-contents.html) with new layout that'll
  allow me to expand on core Python language topics.
* Updated several out of date resources and added a new 
  [logging](/logging.html) resource.
* New [Pyramid](/pyramid.html) resources. I definitely need to flesh that page
  out further.
* Added a [Vim](/vim.html) page and resources for learning Vim as a Python
  code editor.
* Reorganized content pages to make for better logical groupings as I add new
  content.
* Major improvements to [Websockets](/websockets.html) page after suggestions
  from 
  [issue #47 on GitHub repository](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/issues/47).

### January
* Rewrote the Mailchimp sign up form for the email list so it doesn't have
  the external JQuery libraries as dependencies. Site should be even faster
  now.
* Stripped a significant portion of unused Bootstrap boilerplate from the CSS
  file and minified it. The resulting CSS file is over 100KB less (about
  25KB down from 130KB) so the site should load faster now.
* Major update to [WebSockets page](/websockets.html) with new diagrams 
  and better explanations for why server push is useful.
* New task queue resources.
* Major update with the beginning of a page on [Docker](/docker.html), split
  out static file handling resources on the [Django](/django.html) page
  and a new section on Python programming language popularity on the 
  "Why Use Python?" page.
* Working on a [Why Use Python?](/why-use-python.html) page with my own 
  assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of Python along with links to 
  resources where other folks discuss their own experiences.
* Continuing to add WebSockets resources, especially Python-specific ones.
* Added a new separate page for the [Morepath framework](/morepath.html).
