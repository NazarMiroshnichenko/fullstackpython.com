# Application Programming Interfaces
Application programming interfaces (APIs) provide machine-readable
data transfer and signaling between applications.


## Why are APIs important?
HTML, CSS and JavaScript create human-readable webpages. However, those 
webpages are not easily consumable by other machines. Numerous scraping
programs and libraries exist to rip data out of HTML but it's simpler
to consume data through APIs.


## Webhook
A webhook is a user-defined HTTP callback.


## API open source projects
* [Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core) is an open source project 
  written in Scala that defines a standard interface for RESTful APIs.


## API resources
* [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) has an
  [APIs 101](https://zapier.com/blog/apis-101/) free guide for what APIs 
  are, why they are valuable and how to use them properly.
