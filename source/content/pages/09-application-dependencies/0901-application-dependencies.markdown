# Application Dependencies
Application dependencies are the Python libraries and their versions
required for the application to work properly. These dependencies are 
installed separately from system-level packages to prevent library version
conflicts.

The most common way to install Python library dependencies is with 
the [pip install](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/) combined
with [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) to isolate the
dependencies of individual applications from each other.

[Jon Chu](https://twitter.com/jonathanchu) wrote a great introduction on 
[virtualenv and pip basics](http://www.jontourage.com/2011/02/09/virtualenv-pip-basics/).

"[A non-magical introduction to virtualenv and pip](http://dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/) 
breaks down what problems these tools solve and how to use them.

[Tools of the modern Python hacker](http://www.clemesha.org/blog/modern-python-hacker-tools-virtualenv-fabric-pip/) 
contains detailed explanations of virtualenv, Fabric, and pip.
