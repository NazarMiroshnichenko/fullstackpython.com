# Application dependencies
Application dependencies are specific Python libraries and their versions
required for the application to work properly. These dependencies are 
installed separately from system-level packages.

The most common way to install Python library dependencies is with 
the [pip install](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/) combined
with [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) to isolate the
dependencies of individual applications from each other.
