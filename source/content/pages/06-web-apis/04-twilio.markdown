# Twilio
[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python/twiml) is a 
[web application programming interface (API)](/application-programming-interfaces.html)
that software developers can use to add communications such as 
[phone calling](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/browser-calls/python/django), 
[messaging](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/server-notifications/python/django), 
[video](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video/guide/quickstart-js) and 
[two-factor authentication](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/two-factor-authentication/python/flask)
into their [Python](/learning-programming.html) applications.

## Why is Twilio a good API choice?
Interacting with the standard telephone networks to send and receive
phone calls and text messages without Twilio is extremely difficult 
if you do not know the unique telecommunications protocols such as 
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Twilio's API abstracts the 
telecommunications pieces so as a developer you can simply use your 
favorite programming languages and frameworks in your application.
For example, here's how you can send an outbound SMS using a few lines
of Python code:


## How is Twilio's documentation for Python developers?
Twilio is a developer-focused company, rather than a traditional 
"enterprise company", so their tutorials and 
[documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs) are written by developers 
for fellow developers.


### More Twilio resources
* Most [Twilio Tutorials](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials) have 
  idiomatic Python versions with entire open source applications in
  [Django](/django.html) and [Flask](/flask.html).

* The [Python tag on the Twilio blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/tag/python)
  provides walkthroughs for 
  [Django](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/12/city-chat-with-python-django-and-twilio-ip-messaging.html), 
  [Flask](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/11/international-space-station-notifications-with-python-redis-queue-and-twilio-copilot.html) 
  and [Bottle](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/08/getting-started-python-bottle-twilio-sms-mms.html) 
  apps to learn from while building your own projects.

* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
  includes 
  [a chapter on sending text messages](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter16/) 
  that uses Twilio to get the job done.

* [Google Cloud recommends developers use Twilio](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/sms/twilio)
  for communications in their apps and provides a short walkthrough for
  Python developers.
