The majority of production Python web applications rely on several
externally hosted application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs are also
commonly referred to as third party services or external platforms. 
Examples include `Twilio <https://www.twilio.com/>`_ for messaging and voice
services, `Stripe <https://stripe.com/>`_ for payment processing, and
`Disqus <https://disqus.com/>`_ for embedded webpage comments.

There are many articles about proper API design but best practices for 
integrating APIs is less commonly written about. However, this subject 
continuously grows in importance because APIs provide critical functionality
across many implementation areas.
