# Generators
Generators are a Python core language construct that allow a function's return
value to to behave as an iterator. A generator can allow more efficient 
memory usage by allocating and allocating during the context of a large
number of iterations. Generators are defined in 
[PEP255](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/) and included in the
language as of Python 2.2 in 2001.


## Python generator resources
* [An introduction to Python generators](http://intermediatepythonista.com/python-generators)
  by Intermediate Pythonista is a well done post with code examples.

* This blog post entitled 
  [Python Generators](http://rdrewd.blogspot.com/2014/02/python-generators.html)
  specifically focuses on generating dictionaries. It provides a good 
  introduction for those new to Python.

* [Python 201: An Intro to Generators](http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2014/01/27/python-201-an-intro-to-generators/)
  is another short but informative read with example generators code.

* [Iterators & Generators](http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/iterators.html)
  provides code examples for these two constructs and some simple explanations
  for each..

* The question to [Understanding Generators in Python?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1756096/understanding-generators-in-python)
  on Stack Overflow has an impressive answer that clearly lays out the
  code and concepts involved with Python generators.

* [Generator Tricks for Systems Programmers](http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/)
  provides code examples for using generators. The material was originally
  presented in a PyCon workshop for systems programmers but is relevant to
  all Python developers working to understand appropriate ways to use
  generators.
