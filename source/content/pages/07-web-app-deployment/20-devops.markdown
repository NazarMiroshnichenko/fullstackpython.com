# DevOps
DevOps is the combination of application development and operations, which
minimizes or eliminates the disconnect between software developers who build 
applications and systems administrators who keep infrastructure running.


## Why is DevOps important?
When the Agile methodology is properly used to develop software a new
bottleneck often appears during the [deployment](/deployment.html) and 
operations phases. New updates and fixes are produced so fast in each 
sprint that infrastructure teams can be overwhelmed with deployments and 
push back on the pace of delivery. To allievate some of these issues, 
application developers are asked to work closely with operations folks to
automate the delivery from development to production.
