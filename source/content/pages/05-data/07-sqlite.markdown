meta: SQLite is an relational database built into the Python standard library that uses a single file to store data. 


# SQLite
SQLite is an open source relational database included with the Python standard
library as of Python 2.5. The pysqlite database driver is also included with
the standard library so that no further external dependencies are required to
access a SQLite database from within Python applications.
