# Web analytics
Analyzing web traffic involves collecting, calculating, visualizing
and critically thinking about the data generated by visitors' web browsers 
while they are viewing webpages. The resulting data provides insight into 
how visitors use the site and why they stay or leave. The key concept to
analytics is *learning* about your users so you can improve your web 
application to better suit their needs. 

It's easy to get overwhelmed at both the number of analytics services and
the numerous types of data points collected. Focus on just a handful of
metrics when you're just starting out. As your application scales and you 
understand more about your users add additional analytics services 
to gain further insight into their behavior with advanced visualizations such
as heatmaps and action funnels. The
[seven stages of startup analytics grief](http://spenczar.com/posts/2013/Sep/07/seven-stages-analytics-grief/) 
post is an amusing read and provides context for how to begin and then grow 
tracked metrics over time.

## User funnels
If your application is
selling a product or service you can ultimately build a 
[user funnel](http://moz.com/blog/building-your-marketing-funnel-with-google-analytics) (often called "sales funnel" prior to a user becoming a customer)
to better understand why people buy or don't buy what you're selling. With
a funnel you can visualize drop-off points where visitors leave your 
application before taking some action, such as purchasing your service.
