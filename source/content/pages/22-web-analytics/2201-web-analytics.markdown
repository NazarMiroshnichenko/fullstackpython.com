# Web analytics
Analyzing web traffic involves collecting, calculating, visualizing
and critically thinking about the data generated by visitors' web browsers 
while they are viewing webpages. The resulting data provides insight into 
how visitors use the site and why they stay or leave. If your website is
selling a product or service you can ultimately build a 
[user funnel](http://moz.com/blog/building-your-marketing-funnel-with-google-analytics) 
to better understand why people buy or don't buy what you're selling.

It's easy to get overwhelmed at both the number of analytics services and
the numerous types of data points collected. Focus on just a handful of
metrics when you're just starting to run a Python web application. As your
application scales and you understand more about your users then add
additional analytics services to gain further insight into their behavior
with heatmaps and user actions funnels. This sarcastic but accurate post
