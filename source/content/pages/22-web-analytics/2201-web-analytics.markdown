# Web analytics
Analyzing web traffic involves collecting, calculating, visualizing
and critically thinking about the data generated by visitors' web browsers 
while they are viewing webpages. The resulting data provides insight into 
how visitors use the site and why they stay or leave. If your website is
selling a product or service you can ultimately build a 
[user funnel](http://moz.com/blog/building-your-marketing-funnel-with-google-analytics) 
to better understand why people buy or don't buy what you're selling.
