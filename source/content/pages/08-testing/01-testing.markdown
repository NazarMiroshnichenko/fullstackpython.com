# Testing
Testing determines whether software runs correctly based on specific inputs 
and identifies defects that need to be fixed.


## Why is testing important?
As software scales in codebase size, it's impossible for a person or even 
a large team to keep up with all of the changes and
the interactions between the changes. Automated testing is the only proven
method for building reliable software once they grow past the point of a
simple prototype. Many major software program development failures can be
traced back to inadequate or a complete lack of testing.

It's impossible to know whether software works properly unless it is tested.
While testing can be done manually, by a user clicking buttons or typing in 
input, it should be performed automatically by writing software programs that
test the application under test.

There are many forms of testing and they should all be used together. When 
a single function of a program is isolated for testing, that is called
*unit testing*. Testing more than a single function in an application at
the same time is known as *functional testing*. *User interface testing* 
ensures the correctness of how a user would interact with the software.


## Testing in Python
Python software development culture is heavy on software testing. Because
Python is a dynamically-typed language as opposed to a statically-typed
language, testing takes on even greater importance for ensuring program
correctness.


## Testing resources
* Google has a [testing blog](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/) where
  they write about various aspects of testing software at scale.

* [The case for test-driven development](http://michaeldehaan.net/post/120522567217/the-case-for-test-driven-development)
  by Michael DeHaan explains how automation is the only way to build software
  at a large scale.
