# Why Use Python?
Python's expansive library of open source data analysis tools, web frameworks 
and testing tools make its ecosystem one of the largest out of any programming
community. 

Python is also an accessible language for new programmers because
of the extensive availability of free and low cost introdutory resources as
well as being taught in many universities.


## Why does the choice of programming language matter?
Programming languages have unique ecosystems, cultures and philosophies
built around them. You may unfortunately find friction with the community 
and difficulty in learning if your approach to programming varies from the 
philosophy of the programming language you've selected.

Python's culture values open source software, community involvement with 
[local, national and international events](http://www.pycon.org/) and
teaching to new programmers. If those values are also important to you and/or
your organization then Python may be a good fit to use.



### More perspectives on why to use Python
* The Python documentation has a HOWTO section specifically for 
  [Python advocacy](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/advocacy.html).

* [How to argue for Pythonâ€™s use](http://nothingbutsnark.svbtle.com/how-to-argue-for-pythons-use)
  explains that choosing a programming language can be complicated but that
  Python is a very good option for many use cases.

* [Why I Push for Python](http://lorenabarba.com/blog/why-i-push-for-python/)
  explains one professor's rationale for promoting Python to teach programming
  to undergraduates.

* The [PopularitY of Programming Language index](https://sites.google.com/site/pydatalog/pypl/PyPL-PopularitY-of-Programming-Language)
  shows Python continues to be in widespread usage and has leading indicators
  according to Google Trends that it is a highly searched for programming
  language.


### Resources for Python enterprise advocacy
* PayPal covers 
  [10 myths about enterprise Python](https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2014/12/10/10-myths-of-enterprise-python/)
  via their engineering blog.

* My DjangoCon 2014 talk focused on overcoming false biases against 
  [Python and Django in enterprise environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMtiCX38w20).
