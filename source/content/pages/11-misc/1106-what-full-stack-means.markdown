# What "full stack" means
The terms "full stack" and "Full Stack Python" are ambiguous but I am using
a specific definition here on this site. These term can be defined for a 
web stack either to mean

* Python code interacts with code written in other languages such as C and
  JavaScript to provide a complete web stack

or

* Every layer, from the machine code up to the browser, are written in Python 

I named this site for the first definition. Python is just one language among
many that allows our computers to execute software and communicate with each
other. 

For beginners, learning the syntax and libraries in Python necessary to 
build a web application or web API is a major undertaking. Even intermediate 
and advanced Python software developers need to constantly program and learn 
to keep up with our ever evolving ecosystem. I created Full Stack Python to
be just one of [many resources](/best-python-resources.html) that help Python 
developers build and maintain their programming skills.


### What to do now that we've got "full stack" defined?
