# Future Directions
Full Stack Python has completely blown away my expectations for what I could
accomplish with a side project. I really appreciate all the in-person feedback,
emails and pull requests I've received from the community.

For 2015 I'm looking forward to taking FSP far beyond the scope I originally
intended. Here are some thing to watch out for:

1. Reordering of the content, with top level categories for 

    * web frameworks
    * deployment
    * data
    * performance
    * operations
    * security
    * front ends (web and mobile)

1. More visuals such as the diagram on the 
   [source control](/source-control.html) page

1. Step-by-step tutorials instead of just explanations and external resources


Note that these plans can change based on 
[pull requests](https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/pulls)
from the community. I work to integrate PRs within a day or two so please 
submit one when you see a fix or improvement that needs to be made!


### That's what coming. What would you like to learn right now?
