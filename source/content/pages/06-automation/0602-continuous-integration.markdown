# Continuous Integration
Continuous integration (CI) automates building, testing and deploying 
applications.

## Why is continuous integration important?
When CI is set up well it can dramatically reduce deployment times by 
eliminating manual steps and ensure code does not have bugs that are being
checked by automated tests. Source code changes as a project evolves.
CI combined with unit and integration tests check that code modifications 
do not break existing tests ensure the software works as intended.


## Open source CI projects
* [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) is a common CI server for building and
  deploying to test and production servers. 
  [Jenkins source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins).

* [Go CD](http://www.go.cd/) by ThoughtWorks was designed with the build and
  test & release cycles in mind. 
  [Go CD source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/gocd/gocd)

* [Strider](http://stridercd.com/) is a CI server written in node.js. 
  [Strider source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider).


## Hosted CI services
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) provides free CI for open source 
  projects and has a [commercial version](https://travis-ci.com/) for 
  private repositories.

* [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo) is 
  [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/)'s hosted continuous integration that
  is also free for open source projects.

* [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) works with open or closed source projects
  on GitHub and can deploy them to Heroku if builds are successful.
