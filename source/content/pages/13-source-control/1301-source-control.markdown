# Source control
Source control systems, also known as version control systems, store code
and other static files, such as images, with a history of the changes made to
those files.

Version control is required for all software development projects whether 
you're an independent one person show or part of a large developer team. 


## Source Control Systems
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version
control system.

[Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) is similar to Git, also a free
and open source distributed version control system.


## Source Control Third Party Services
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is currently the most commonly used source
control platform for using Git.

[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) provides free Git and Mercurial 
repositories for open projects and private repositories for up to five
users. Users pay for hosting private repositories with more than five users.
