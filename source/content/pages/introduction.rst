You're knee deep in learning the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_
programming language. The syntax is beginning to make sense. The first
few "AHA!" moments are hitting you. Now you are excited for continued 
direction to accelerate your learning.

This guide explains each piece of a Python web stack. If you want to deploy
a web application built with Django, Flask, Pyramid, or another
Python-based web framework, you've come to the right place.

There are a few other fantastic Python guides that you may want to read if
you're not yet ready to deploy your application.

For general Python learning, read Kenneth Reitz's 
`The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/>`_.

To get an introduction to both Python and Django at the same time, purchase
`Real Python <http://www.realpython.com/>`_ by Fletcher, Michael, and Jeremy.

To deploy a Python web application to the Heroku platform-as-a-service 
(described below in this guide), check out 
`Deploying Django <http://www.deploydjango.com/>`_ by Randall Degges.

If you're not coming in with any software development background, 
you may also find my post on 
`Learning Python <http://www.mattmakai.com/learning-python-for-non-developers.html>`_ 
useful.

This guide has a different focus from the above resources. Here I 
focus on explaining the way a Python *web application* stack works from 
server infrastructure through JavaScript execution on a user's browser.

People learning Python generally have at least one of the three following
goals:

1. Build web applications
2. Process, analyze, and visualize data
3. Script server administration

This guide will be most useful to people building web applications and 
scripting server administration.
