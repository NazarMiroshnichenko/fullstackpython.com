You're knee deep in learning the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_
programming language. The syntax is starting to make sense. The first
few "AHA!" moments are hitting you as you're building applications with
a web framework. 

Now you want to know how to take your web application code and make it
live on the Web. That's where this guide comes in. If you want to gain
an understanding of everything you need to deploy and run a production Python
web application, you've come to the right place. 

If you're not yet ready to deploy your application there are a few other 
fantastic Python guides that you can read first: 

* For general Python learning, read Kenneth Reitz's 
  `The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/>`_.  
* To get an introduction to both Python and Django at the same time, read
  `Real Python <http://www.realpython.com/>`_ by Fletcher, Michael, and Jeremy.

* To deploy a Python web application to the Heroku platform-as-a-service 
  (described below in this guide), check out 
  `Deploying Django <http://www.deploydjango.com/>`_ by Randall Degges.

* If you're not coming in with any software development background, 
  you may find my post on 
  `Learning Python <http://www.mattmakai.com/learning-python-for-non-developers.html>`_ 
  useful.

This guide has a different focus from the above resources. Here you will 
learn what server options exist, which operating system to use, what the 
Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) standard is, and so on up through the 
action that takes place in the user's browser.

Read on once you have a basic understanding of Python plus a web framework 
and are ready to learn more about the full Python web stack.
