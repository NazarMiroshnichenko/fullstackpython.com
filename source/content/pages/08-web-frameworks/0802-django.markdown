# Django
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) is a widely used Python web 
application framework with a "batteries-included" philosophy. The principle
behind batteries-included is that the common functionality for building
web applications should come with the framework instead of as a separate
library. For example, 
[URL routing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/), a 
[templating system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/),
[object-relational mapper](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/),
and [database schema migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/)
(as of version 1.7) are all included with the [Django framework](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/1.6.2).
