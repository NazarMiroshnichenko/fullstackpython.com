# JavaScript
JavaScript is a small scripting programming language embedded in web browsers 
to enable dynamic content. 


## Where does JavaScript come from?
JavaScript is an implementation of 
[the ECMAScript specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/JavaScript_Overview) 
which is defined by the 
[Ecma International Standards Body](http://www.ecma-international.org/default.htm).
