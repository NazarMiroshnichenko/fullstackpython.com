Configuration Management
------------------------
Configuration management involves modifying servers from an existing state to 
a desired state. Numerous tools exist to modify the state in a controlled 
way, including `Puppet <http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet>`_, 
`Chef <http://www.getchef.com/chef/>`_, 
`SaltStack <http://www.saltstack.com/>`_, and Ansible. Puppet and Chef are
written in Ruby, while SaltStack and Ansible are written in Python.

management and application deployment tool built in Python.
