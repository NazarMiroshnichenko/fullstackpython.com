# Python Programming Language
The Python programming language is an 
[open source](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/), 
[widely-used](/why-use-python.html) tool for 
creating software applications.


## What is Python used for?
Python is often used to [build](/web-frameworks.html) and [deploy](/deployment.html) 
[web applications](/web-development.html) and 
[web APIs](/application-programming-interfaces.html). Python
can also analyze and visualize [data](/data.html) 
and [test software](/testing.html), even if the software being
tested was not written in Python.


## General Python programming language resources
* The [online Python tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/) visually walks
  through code and shows how it executes on the Python interpreter.

* [Python Module of the Week](http://pymotw.com/2/index.html) is a tour
  through the Python standard library.

* [What the heck does "pythonic" mean?](http://halitalptekin.tumblr.com/post/30028271874/pythonic-syntax)
  explains the difference in accepted Python coding style compared to other
  ways to write Python code that, while syntactically correct, are less
  maintainable and therefore should not be used.

* [A Python interpreter written in Python](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-python-interpreter-written-in-python.html)
  is incredibly meta but really useful for wrapping your head around some
  of the lower level stuff going on in the language.

* [A few things to remember while coding in Python](http://satyajit.ranjeev.in/2012/05/17/python-a-few-things-to-remember.html)
  is a nice collection of good practices to use while building programs
  with the language. 

* [Python internals: adding a new statement to Python](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/06/30/python-internals-adding-a-new-statement-to-python/)

* [Python tricks that you can't live without](http://www.slideshare.net/audreyr/python-tricks-that-you-cant-live-without)
  is a slideshow by Audrey Roy that goes over code readability, linting,
  dependency isolation, and other good Python practices.

* [Python innards introduction](http://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/04/02/pythons-innards-introduction/)
  explains how some of Python's internal execution happens.

* [What is a metaclass in Python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-is-a-metaclass-in-python)
  is one of the best Stack Overflow answers about Python.

* Armin Roacher presented [things you didn't know about Python](https://speakerdeck.com/mitsuhiko/didntknow)
  at PyCon South Africa in 2012.

* [Writing idiomatic Python](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/10/04/writing-idiomatic-python/)
  is a guide for writing Pythonic code.

* [The thing that runs your Python](http://ashfall.github.io/blog/2012/10/23/the-thing-that-runs-your-python/)
  is a summary of what one developer learned about PyPy while researching it.
