# JavaScript
JavaScript is a small scripting programming language embedded in web browsers 
to enable dynamic content and interaction. 


## Why is JavaScript necessary?
JavaScript executes in the client and enables dynamic content and interaction
that is not possible with HTML and CSS alone. 


## JavaScript learning checklist
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Create a simple HTML file with basic elements in it. Use the
``python -m SimpleHTTPServer`` command to serve it up. Create a 
``<script type="text/javascript"></script>`` 
element at the end of the ``<body>`` section in the HTML page. Start playing 
with JavaScript within that element to learn the basic syntax.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Download [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) and add it to the page above your 
JavaScript element. Start working with JQuery and learning how it makes basic
JavaScript easier.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Work with JavaScript on the page. Incorporate examples from open source 
projects listed below as well as JQuery plugins. Check out the Unheap link
below to find a large collection of categorized JQuery plugins.

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Integrate JavaScript into your web application and check the 
[static content](/static-content.html) section for how to host the JavaScript
files.


## Where did JavaScript originate?
JavaScript is an implementation of 
[the ECMAScript specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/JavaScript_Overview) 
which is defined by the 
[Ecma International Standards Body](http://www.ecma-international.org/default.htm).

  rendered in a browser.

* [A re-introduction to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)

  is a huge list by Smashing Magazine with explanations for each tool and 
  library for working with JavaScript.
