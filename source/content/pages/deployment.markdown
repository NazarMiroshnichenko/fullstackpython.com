# Deployment
Deployment means packaging up your web application and putting it in a 
production environment that can run the app.


## Why is deployment necessary?
Your web application must live somewhere other than your own desktop or 
laptop. A production environment is a canonical version of your current 
application and its associated data.


## Deployment hosting options
There are four options for deploying and hosting a web application:

1. "Bare metal" servers

2. Virtualized servers

3. Infrastructure-as-a-service

4. Platform-as-a-service
