# Deployment
Deployment involves packaging up your web application and putting it in a 
production environment that can run the app.


## Why is deployment necessary?
Your web application must live somewhere other than your own desktop or 
laptop. A production environment is the canonical version of your current 
application and its associated data.


## Deployment hosting options
There are four options for deploying and hosting a web application:

1. "Bare metal" servers

2. Virtualized servers

3. Infrastructure-as-a-service

4. Platform-as-a-service


## Deployment resources

  walks through stages of deployment with source control, planning, 
  continuous deployment and monitoring the results.

* [Practical continuous deployment](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/04/practical-continuous-deployment/)
  defines delivery versus deployment and walks through a continuous deployment
  workflow.
