Application dependencies are specific Python libraries and their versions
required for the application to work properly. These dependencies are 
installed separately from system-level packages.

The most common way to install Python library dependencies is with 
the `pip install <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_ combined
with `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/>`_ to isolate the
dependencies of individual applications from each other.
