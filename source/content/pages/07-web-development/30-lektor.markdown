# Lektor
[Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/) is a static website generator with 
content management system (CMS) and [web framework](/web-frameworks.html) 
features for creating websites. Lektor's
[source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/lektor/lektor) 
under the 
[BSD 3-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

## How is Lektor different from other static site generators?
Most static site generators such as [Pelican](/pelican.html) are built with
programmers as the primary user. Lektor tries to be more accessible to
non-programmers by providing an admin panel for creating and updating
site content similar to Django or Wordpress.

## Lektor resources
Lektor is a young project and therefore has a nascent community compared with
[Pelican](/pelican.html) and Jekyll (the most popular Ruby-based static 
site generator). However, the official documentation and initial quickstarts 
for the project are wonderful so getting a basic site up and running is 
painless.

* [Introducing Lektor](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2015/12/21/introducing-lektor/)
  is the background story for what motivated 
  [Armin Ronacher](https://github.com/mitsuhiko) to start hacking on his own
  static site generator project after jumping around from Django to Wordpress
  for hosting content. The post also includes details on the differences 
  in the project compared to other static site generators.

* The [official Lektor quickstart](https://www.getlektor.com/docs/quickstart/)
  contains the first commands to use to generate a new project scaffold.
  There is also a getting started screencast that walks through installing
  and initial steps for getting set up with the project.

* [Converting to Lektor](http://www.dreisbach.us/blog/converting-to-lektor/)
  provides a quick hack for converting exported content in XML from 
  [Silvrback](https://www.silvrback.com/) to a format that Lektor can use
  to generate a new site.
