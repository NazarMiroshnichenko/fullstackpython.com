# MkDocs
[MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) 
([source code](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/)), pronounced 
"[McDocs](https://twitter.com/_tomchristie/status/805861272076042241)" with
a Scottish accent or perhaps "Make Docs" otherwise, is a static site 
generator that combines Markdown content with 
[Jinja2 templates](/jinja2.html) to produce websites. MkDocs uses 
a YAML configuration file and can optionally use themes to easy change the 
look-and-feel of the documentation output.
