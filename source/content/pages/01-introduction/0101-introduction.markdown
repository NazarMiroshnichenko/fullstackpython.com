# Introduction
You're knee deep in learning the [Python](http://www.python.org/)
programming language. The syntax is starting to make sense. The first
few "AHA!" moments are hitting you as you're building applications with
a web framework. 

Now you want to know how to take your web application code and make it
live on the Web. That's where this guide comes in. If you want to gain
an understanding of everything you need to deploy and run a production Python
web application, you've come to the right place. 

If you're not yet ready to deploy your application there are a few other 
[fantastic Python guides](../best-python-resources.html) that you can read 
first.

This guide has a different focus from other Python resources. In each section
of this guide you will learn topics such as what server options exist, 
which operating system to use, what the Web Server Gateway Interface 
(WSGI) standard is, and so on up through the action that takes place in 
the user's browser.

Read on once you have a basic Python understanding and are ready to 
learn more about the full Python web stack.
